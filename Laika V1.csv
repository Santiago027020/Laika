The objective was to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of physiological systems' adaptation to prolonged microgravity and their post-flight readaptation using male C57BL/6N mice. The project combined in vivo measurements (behavior, blood pressure) during and after flight with extensive in vitro studies of various tissues. A rigorous mouse training and selection program was implemented, including adaptation to group housing and specific diets. The mice returned in good condition and showed signs of maladaptation to Earth's gravity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the training program and the feasibility of using male mice in future space-based biomedical research.",8
"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,"Microgravity, bone loss, spaceflight, osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteocytic osteolysis, bone remodeling, cell cycle arrest, CDKN1a/p21, MMPs, p53, mice, pelvis, ischium, µCT, nanoCT, lacuna enlargement, bone volume fraction, bone thickness, mechanical unloading, osteogenesis","This study in mice exposed to microgravity for 15 days reveals rapid and significant bone loss in the pelvis, including a 6.29% reduction in bone volume fraction and 11.91% reduction in thickness, in addition to a 170% increase in the bone surface area covered by osteoclasts. Beyond the known osteoclastic activity, the findings demonstrate microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, evidenced by an increase in the area (+17%) and perimeter (+14%) of bone lacunae and the overexpression of MMP10 in osteocytes. In parallel, elevated CDKN1a/p21 expression in osteoblasts suggests cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis, which compromises bone regenerative capacity. These newly identified pathways (osteocytic osteolysis and osteogenic cell cycle arrest) dramatically expand our understanding of bone degeneration in space, indicating that the problem is more complex than osteoclastic resorption alone and is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures for long-duration space missions.",9
Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/,"Microgravity, human health, immune system, cancer biology, cardiomyocytes, tissue regeneration, stem cells, space medicine, astronaut health, biological processes, apoptosis, multicellular spheroids, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis","Microgravity profoundly impacts biological systems, bearing dual significance for space missions and terrestrial health. It profoundly compromises the immune system by disrupting T cell activation and macrophage function, leading to increased astronaut susceptibility to infections and underscoring the need for protective measures in prolonged spaceflight. Concurrently, microgravity surprisingly enhances tissue regeneration, particularly improving stem cell differentiation into cardiac cells with advanced maturation and functional improvements, which offers promising therapeutic avenues for heart conditions like myocardial infarctions. In oncology, microgravity promotes multicellular spheroid formation in cancer cells, creating valuable models for research, and uniquely alters cancer stem cell properties, potentially increasing their susceptibility to treatment. These discoveries highlight microgravity's potential to advance regenerative medicine, oncology, and immunological interventions, crucial for both astronaut well-being and transformative biomedical applications on Earth.",9

A key finding included the successful on-orbit mitigation of gas bubble formation during thermal cycling, highlighting system adaptability. This breakthrough establishes critical autonomous molecular biology capabilities for future deep space missions, enabling immediate disease diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and research applications such as optimizing plant growth or assessing astronaut health, thereby eliminating the delays and sample degradation associated with Earth-return analysis and significantly advancing scientific discovery and operational independence in space.",9
Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/,"spaceflight, microgravity, heart, gene expression, oxidative stress, Nfe2l2, NADPH oxidase, Ptgs2, Cdkn1a, Myc, cardiovascular changes, cardiac deconditioning, Trp53, cell cycle, apoptosis, redox balance, cardiac dysfunction, inflammatory response, mice","Spaceflight induces substantial changes in cardiac gene expression, revealing molecular pathways contributing to cardiovascular deconditioning. Key findings include a persistent increase in oxidative stress, evidenced by downregulated Nfe2l2 (a critical oxidative defense regulator) and upregulated Nox1, alongside altered cell cycle regulation with increased Cdkn1a and Myc, and reduced inflammatory responses. Computational analysis further linked these specific molecular alterations to potential cardiovascular pathologies like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. These results underscore that long-duration space missions pose a significant risk of cardiac dysfunction driven by these molecular-level stress responses, necessitating targeted countermeasures and advanced monitoring strategies to ensure astronaut cardiovascular health and mission success.",8

High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/,"Fatigue, Bone mechanics, Mouse, Vertebrae, Bone quality, Cyclic loading, Biomechanical testing, Precision, Finite element analysis, Micro-CT, Stiffness, Strain, Fatigue life, Specimen preparation, Loading plates, Machine compliance, Ex vivo, Small animals, Osteoporosis, Fracture risk, Statistical power","This paper describes the development of a new and accurate method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies, aiming to improve bone quality assessment in small animals. Existing methods are challenged by small bone size and machine compliance, which introduces variability in results. The new technique features the use of 3D-printed support templates to machine plane-parallel surfaces, pivoting loading platens to ensure uniform contact, and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis, allowing stiffness measurements and prescribing force levels that produce the same level of deformation. When comparing the new method with two common techniques in the literature on mouse L5 vertebrae, a significant reduction in dispersion in mechanical behavior was demonstrated, with a fatigue life standard deviation up to five times lower. This increased precision facilitates a better understanding of bone quality and optimizes statistical power in animal experiments.",8
Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813909/,"ionizing radiation, bone, collagen, bone strength, fatigue, collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, radiation doses, sterilization, radiotherapy, bone allografts, ex vivo, mouse vertebrae, fracture, AGEs, micro-CT, electrophoresis","An ex vivo study in mouse vertebrae examined the mechanism behind ionizing radiation-induced bone weakening, focusing on whether it is caused by collagen fragmentation or non-enzymatic cross-linking. Bone samples were exposed to various doses of X-rays (from 0 to 35,000 Gy), and the compressive mechanical properties and biochemical changes of collagen were measured. The findings indicated that the reduction in bone strength and fatigue life was only significant at high doses (17,000 and 35,000 Gy), which coincided with the onset of collagen fragmentation. Although nonenzymatic collagen crosslinking increased at all radiation doses, changes in mechanical properties were most consistently correlated with collagen fragmentation. It is concluded that the deterioration in bone strength and fatigue life due to ionizing radiation is more likely a consequence of collagen backbone fragmentation than of increased nonenzymatic crosslinking.",8

Signaling pathways activated by passive stretch were examined in myotubes and muscles isolated from C57 and ?-sarcoglycan-depleted mice. The results showed that basal p70S6K activation was elevated in ?-sarcoglycan-depleted muscles, independent of calcium. Although stretch increased p70S6K activation in both muscle types, the response was sustained in Î³-sarcoglycan-deficient muscles, unlike the transient response observed in wild-type muscles. Furthermore, the loss of Î³-sarcoglycan impaired rapamycin's ability to completely reduce downstream S6RP phosphorylation. These findings suggest that p70S6K is key in Î³-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction and that Î³-sarcoglycan is essential for the inactivation of this pathway, implying that impaired cargo-sensing mechanisms contribute to the pathology of sarcoglycan-deficient muscular dystrophies.",8

Single mutants of AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c were found to exhibit no notable morphological changes, but the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant exhibits shorter siliques and produces deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips, resulting in unfertilized ovules and lower seed set. Both genes have overlapping expression patterns and are localized to Golgi bodies, suggesting a partially redundant role in vesicle trafficking during pollen development, germination, and pollen tube elongation that cannot be supplied by other members of the AtRabD family.",8

TNO1 mutants display increased sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress, as well as altered SYP41 localization and decreased membrane fusion efficiency. These findings suggest that TNO1 is involved in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity, possibly in conjunction with the SNARE complex SYP41.",8
Functional redundancy between trans-Golgi network SNARE family members in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11500582/,"AtGTLP, Arabidopsis thaliana, glycosyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, O-fucosyltransferase, membrane trafficking, SNARE proteins, SYP43, Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network, glycosylation, subcellular localization, mutant phenotype, colocalization","The present study investigates AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana Glycosyltransferase-Like Protein), a novel membrane-anchored protein that interacts with the Qa-SNARE SYP43 in the trans-Golgi network. Named for its sequence similarity to metazoan fucosyltransferases, AtGTLP is predicted to be a novel member of an as yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases. Colocalization data indicate that AtGTLP localizes mainly to the Golgi apparatus, especially the trans-Golgi network. *atgtlp?/? single mutants showed no obvious phenotypic differences, suggesting that AtGTLP and related proteins with high sequence similarity may have redundant functions.",8

Microtubule stabilization increases skewing in these mutant roots, while its destabilization causes severe defects in cell morphology, although microtubule orientation is not affected. It is concluded that TNO1 regulates skewing in a microtubule-dependent manner, but without altering microtubule orientation, and is essential for maintaining cell morphology in mature root regions.",7
Gravitropism and lateral root emergence are dependent on the trans-Golgi network protein TNO1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642138/,"auxin, trans-Golgi network, lateral root, gravitropism, tethering factor, TNO1, protein trafficking, auxin transport, root development","TNO1 is a protein located in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) that interacts with SYP41 and is essential for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. This study demonstrates that the *tno1* mutant exhibits defects related to auxin transport, including delayed lateral root emergence, reduced gravitropic curvature in plant organs, and increased auxin sensitivity. A reduction in auxin asymmetry was observed in lateral root tips and delayed auxin transport during gravistimulation, whereas endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected. These results suggest that TNO1 mediates responses to auxin during root development and gravity stimulation, possibly through trafficking of auxin-binding proteins.",7

The results suggest that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a microtubule-dependent manner, but not in a microtubule-dependent manner. Furthermore, TNO1 is essential for maintaining cell morphology in mature regions of roots and hypocotyls, implying that the SNARE machinery of the trans-Golgi network is important for proper epidermal cell turnover and cell expansion during root growth.",7
The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin to maintain association of the basal body and spermatid nucleus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/,"Spag4, Spermatogenesis, Centriole attachment, SUN protein, KASH protein, LINC complex, Yuri Gagarin, Dynein-dynactin, Drosophila, Nuclear envelope, Centriole, Sperm basal body, Centrosome, Coiled-coil proteins","This study characterizes the *Drosophila* Spag4 protein, a putative SUN ortholog, and its crucial role in spermatogenesis. It demonstrates that Spag4 is essential for centriole-nucleus tethering, dynamically localizing to testis germline nuclei and concentrating at the centriole anchoring site. Unlike typical LINC complexes, Spag4 function does not require KASH proteins, but rather the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin, which localizes identically and whose activities, together with those of dynein-dynactin, act downstream of Spag4. The absence of Spag4 causes dissociation of nuclei and centrioles/basal bodies after meiosis, resulting in male infertility.",8

Researchers analyzed immune responses under hypergravity and microgravity conditions (spaceflight), focusing on the Toll (for fungal infections) and IMD (for bacterial infections) signaling pathways. They found that hypergravity enhances resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections, a host-dependent effect, as a gravitactic mutant did not show this enhancement. In contrast, development in microgravity during spaceflight altered gene transcription, activating the heat shock stress system. Specifically, flies exposed to space failed to activate the Toll pathway after being infected with fungi, although the Imd pathway responded normally to bacterial infections. The key findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, with spaceflight producing stress-related transcriptional responses and a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated immune response.",9

Researchers analyzed transcriptomic datasets from animal models exposed to radiation, both in ground-based and spaceflight studies, with different ion types and doses. The results identified distinct biosignatures and specific cellular responses, such as changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways, that correlate with radiation exposure and dose. The study concludes that GeneLab's rich database can be used to generate new hypotheses and improve understanding of the human health risks associated with GCR exposures in space.",9

Using metagenomic data from the Microbial Tracking-1 project and a deep learning model, the study overcame traditional sequence similarity thresholds to identify AMR genes in 226 culturable strains, metagenomic samples, and assembled genomes. The results revealed a prevalence of AMR on postflight, particularly in bacteria such as *Kalamiella piersonii* (associated with human urinary tract infections), *Enterobacter bugandensis*, and *Bacillus cereus*, which showed high resistance to antibiotics such as beta-lactams. This demonstrates the utility of machine learning in uncovering hidden AMR determinants, improving our understanding of ISS microbiomes and their pathogenic potential.",9

The objective is to summarize current research and identify future needs to ensure safety during long-duration exploration missions and the post-flight care of astronauts. Space radiation, distinct from terrestrial radiation in its type and energy (including high-energy particles that penetrate shields and tissues), causes complex DNA damage and increases the risk of cancer. Although microgravity also generates significant physiological changes, research on its specific effects on the female reproductive system and gender differences is limited, underscoring the need for further studies in light of the high cumulative radiation doses expected during long-term missions.",10

A strong correlation was found between a specific pattern of gene expression in the liver, linked to glucose conservation and energy saving, and the gene expression of energy-intensive muscle processes such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation. The results indicate that altered liver lipid metabolism and muscle atrophy are associated events during spaceflight, and that dietary changes represent a potential countermeasure.",8

Researchers assessed the spatial patterns of DNA methylation induced by high (56Fe, 28Si) and low (X-ray) linear energy transfer radiation, as well as the role of chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of the cell nucleus. They found that 56Fe causes a persistent increase in DNA methylation, whereas 28Si and X-rays induce a non-persistent decrease. The study highlights the importance of nuclear chromatin architecture in the cellular response to external radiation, offering new insights into the epigenetic and transcriptomic response to GCR damage, vital information for minimizing adverse effects during space travel.",7

This study addressed the limited understanding of the connection between these changes and the development of diseases, such as frailty syndrome, in space. Using rodent data from NASA's GeneLab and astronaut data from JAXA and Inspiration4 missions, biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia were analyzed. The findings revealed significant changes in gene expression patterns and enrichment of pathways related to aging and inflammation in rodent and human muscles, suggesting the development of a frailty-like condition during spaceflight. Specifically, an increase in the inflammatory immune response and downregulation of the IGF-1 pathway were observed in the soleus muscle. These results indicate that the similarities between spaceflight and aging extend to frailty, warranting future research into the use of a frailty index to monitor astronaut health and develop countermeasures.",7
Space radiation damage rescued by inhibition of key spaceflight associated miRNAs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166944/,"space, radiation, damage, rescued, inhibition, key","This study developed a strategy to mitigate space radiation damage in astronauts based on the identification of a key microRNA signature. Using 3D cultures of human microvessels exposed to simulated radiation and treated with specific antagomirs (miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, let-7a-5p), a significant reduction in inflammation and double-stranded DNA damage was achieved, along with recovery of mitochondrial functions. The antagomirs also preserved microvessel morphology and restored angiogenesis. Validated with astronaut data and mouse models, the study confirms that the genes and pathways involved are altered in humans and that microRNAs play a crucial role in DNA repair pathways. These findings suggest a promising countermeasure to protect astronaut health during space missions.",8

This shift has exposed significant shortcomings in existing regulations, ethical guidelines, and medical frameworks, which were primarily designed for government astronauts. Because space travel carries severe health risks, there is an urgent need to develop new policies and practices that address the selection, training, and human research of these non-professional travelers, whose oversight is currently limited. The opportunity to collect health data on these diverse crews also demands strict regulation.",8
Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,"innate, immune, responses, drosophila, melanogaster, are","This study investigates how the space environment affects pathogenic bacteria, using *Serratia marcescens* and *Drosophila melanogaster* as models. *Serratia marcescens* grown on the International Space Station was found to be significantly more lethal to flies than ground-based control samples. A similar increase in virulence was observed in bacteria grown under simulated microgravity conditions on Earth. However, this increased virulence was temporary and was lost upon re-growing the bacteria under terrestrial conditions, suggesting reversible physiological rather than genetic changes. Bacteria exposed to spaceflight also showed increased growth rates in vitro and in the host at later stages. The findings indicate that the space environment, especially microgravity, induces complex physiological changes in pathogenic bacteria that increase their virulence, underscoring the need to understand these mechanisms.",8
Prolonged Exposure to Microgravity Reduces Cardiac Contractility and Initiates Remodeling in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787258/,"prolonged exposure, microgravity, reduces, cardiac, contractility","The paper describes research on the effects of microgravity on cardiac health using the fruit fly (Drosophila) model. The results show that exposure to microgravity aboard the International Space Station causes cardiac dysfunction, including reduced cardiac contraction, myofibrillar remodeling, and decreased cardiac output. Genetic and molecular analysis revealed reduced expression of sarcomere and extracellular matrix-related genes and significantly increased expression of proteasomal genes, along with the formation of proteasome aggregates, amyloid, and polyQ deposits, suggesting abnormal proteostatic stress. These effects, which include cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress, were observed in both wild-type and sei/hERG mutant flies, indicating a fundamental response of cardiac muscle to microgravity and underscoring the importance of understanding these mechanisms for long-term space exploration.",8
Regulation of plant gravity sensing and signaling by the actin cytoskeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/,"regulation, plant, gravity, sensing, and signaling","Primary root growth is essential for the plant, allowing it to anchor and seek nutrients. The actin cytoskeleton is critical in this process, integrating environmental and hormonal stimuli and regulating cell division and elongation. This article reviews how actin, its binding proteins, hormones (especially auxin), and certain drugs affect growth and actin organization in the root. Actin is crucial for cell elongation, characterized by longitudinal bundles and dynamism, and is involved in protein trafficking and vacuolar remodeling. Furthermore, actin mediates the root's response to gravity (statolith perception and auxin transport) and is influenced by light.

HLB1 Is a Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain-Containing Protein That Operates at the Intersection of the Exocytic and Endocytic Pathways at the TGN/EE in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4826010/,"hlb1, tetratricopeptide, repeat, domain containing, protein, that","This article identifies and characterizes the HLB1 (HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1) protein in *Arabidopsis thaliana* through a genetic screen that searched for mutants hypersensitive to the actin-disrupting drug latrunculin B. HLB1 is a plant-only protein that associates with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and traffics along filamentous actin, suggesting that it links post-Golgi trafficking to the actin cytoskeleton. HLB1 was found to interact with MIN7/BEN1, and it is proposed that both proteins form a complex with actin to modulate TGN/EE function at the intersection of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways in plants.",8
ERULUS is a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase that specifies root hair growth by maintaining tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium oscillations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048781/,"erulus, plasma, membrane localized, receptor like, kinase, that","This study refutes a previous model by Bai et al. (2014) that the CAP1/ERULUS (ERU) protein localizes to the tonoplast and regulates root hair growth via ammonium (NH4+) homeostasis, with mutants presumably lacking cytoplasmic calcium (cyt) gradients at the tip. In contrast, this investigation demonstrates that ERU localizes to the plasma membrane and post-Golgi/endocytic vesicles at the root hair tip, becoming intensified during rapid growth. Furthermore, `eru` mutants do exhibit cyt gradients at the tip, albeit with compromised oscillations (lower frequency and higher amplitude) compared to the wild type. The authors suggest that previous findings on Cyt localization and the absence of gradients were based on inadequate expression methods and the analysis of non-growing root hairs. In conclusion, ERU is a CrRLK1L-like receptor kinase located at the plasma membrane, essential for maintaining normal Cyt oscillations at the tip, a process crucial for sustained root hair growth.",7
Brassinosteroids inhibit autotropic root straightening by modifying filamentous-actin organization and dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/,"brassinosteroids, inhibit, autotropic, root, straightening, modifying","This study investigated how epi-brassinolide (eBL) enhances radicular gravitropism, the downward growth of roots, proposing that it acts similarly to the actin inhibitor latrunculin B (LatB) by influencing filamentous actin (F-actin) and autotropism. Experiments in maize and Medicago truncatula roots revealed that both eBL and LatB not only enhance downward root growth but, crucially, inhibit autotropic righting (the ability of the root to correct its trajectory following a gravitational stimulus) in a clinostat, resulting in persistent curvature. Furthermore, eBL was observed to modify F-actin organization and dynamics, although its impact was less pronounced than that of LatB. These findings suggest that eBL's effect on enhancing gravitropism is due to the inhibition of autotropic straightening, mediated in part by alterations in F-actin organization and dynamics.",7
Cell type-specific imaging of calcium signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots using GCaMP3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503278/,"cell, type specific, imaging, calcium, signaling, arabidopsis","This study introduces new *Arabidopsis thaliana* lines that express the calcium sensor GCaMP3 in a targeted manner in five specific root cell types (columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts), overcoming the limitations of constitutive promoters. The researchers verified accurate expression and examined the cytoplasmic calcium (cyt) responses of these cells to environmental stimuli such as ATP and glutamate. Both similarities and differences in cyt signatures were found between the different cell types, taking into account the responses induced by the control solution. These *Arabidopsis* lines represent a valuable resource for further understanding how environmental stimuli connect with specific root development pathways through calcium signaling.",7
Spatial and temporal localization of SPIRRIG and WAVE/SCAR reveal roles for these proteins in actin-mediated root hair development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8364238/,spatial and temporal localization spirrig wave,"This study explores the development of root hairs in Arabidopsis, which are crucial for nutrient and water acquisition through apical growth. The protein SPIRRIG (SPI), involved in membrane trafficking, was found to accumulate at the root hair apex and positively regulate apical growth by maintaining vesicle secretion and the integrity of filamentous actin. Furthermore, the BRK1 and SCAR2 subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) complex mark the root hair initiation domain, specifying their emergence position. SPI-deficient mutants showed reduced apical growth, and root hair emergence was impaired in W/SC mutants. These findings suggest that SPI facilitates actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis, through pathways that could interact with the W/SC complex.",7
Microgravity Stress: Bone and Connective Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11579474/,"microgravity, stress, bone, and, connective, tissue","This study investigated the impact of different gravitational forces (microgravity, 1/6 g and 1 g) on mice on the International Space Station for 25–35 days, focusing on behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen. Microgravity was found to significantly reduce bone density, which was mostly restored by 1 g but only partially by 1/6 g, and caused thymic atrophy, which was half restored by both gravities. Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed some microgravity-induced changes in bone marker gene expression, and lunar gravity (1/6 g) also partially, but not completely, reversed changes in thymic gene expression. In the spleen, gene expression alterations were noted without histological changes. The study highlighted organ-specific variations in the response to gravity, serving as an animal test to establish a molecular-level gravity threshold essential for health in future spaceflight.",9
S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in vivo but of variable stoichiometries in vitro: implications for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998437/,"aureus, mscl, pentamer, living, but variable","This paper addresses the oligomeric state of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL from *S. aureus* (SaMscL), whose stoichiometry has been inconsistent in previous studies, with crystal structures revealing tetrameric or pentameric forms. Using an in vivo disulfide-trapping approach, SaMscL was shown to be predominantly pentameric in the cell, establishing this as its physiologically relevant form. In vitro experiments with detergents such as Triton X-100 and C8E5 corroborated the pentameric stoichiometry, while the use of LDAO, the detergent from the previous crystallography, reversibly induced a tetrameric configuration. This suggests that detergents can alter the stoichiometry of membrane proteins, highlighting the need for in vivo assays to determine their true functional oligomeric state.",7
Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005423/,"manipulating, permeation, charged, compounds, through, mscl","The large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) is an essential bacterial sensor for osmoregulation and cell protection. Due to its properties, it is considered ideal for drug-delivery nanodevices, where the introduction of charges into its pore allows it to be activated without membrane tension, functioning as a nanoswitch. However, this study investigated whether the presence of charges in the pore not only activates the channel but also affects the permeation of large charged molecules, which is crucial for the efficiency of such devices. Using in vivo and electrophysiological approaches, wild-type MscL was shown to have a slight anion preference. The alteration of charged residues and the introduction of post-translational charges significantly modulated this ionic preference and anion passage. Furthermore, the release of K+, glutamate, and trehalose was observed in modified E. coli bacteria, even without membrane tension. The results conclude that the introduction of charges into the lumen of the MscL pore effectively influences the permeation of charged molecules, with more dramatic effects for larger compounds and related to channel orientation, which has important implications for the design of drug delivery devices.",6
The oligomeric state of the truncated mechanosensitive channel of large conductance shows no variance in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190158/,oligomeric state truncated mechanosensitive channel large,"The E. coli mechanosensitive large-conductance channel (MscL) is essential for cell survival in the face of osmotic shock. Although the crystal structures of the MscL orthologs from M. tuberculosis (pentamer) and truncated S. aureus (tetramer) showed discrepancies in their oligomeric state, previous research has shown that full-length SaMscL is a pentamer in its native environment and that detergent solubilization can induce tetramerization. This study used an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique to assess the role of the C-terminal region of SaMscL in its oligomerization in native membranes. The results indicated that SaMscL constructs, including those with C-terminal truncations (such as the one crystallized as a tetramer), maintain pentameric stoichiometry in vivo. This suggests that the C-terminal domain of SaMscL only plays a critical role in its oligomeric state when the protein is solubilized in detergent, not in native membranes, highlighting the importance of in vivo assessments given the ability of detergents to alter the structure of membrane proteins.",7
Three routes to modulate the pore size of the MscL channel/nanovalve,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289768/,"three, routes, modulate, pore, size, mscl","The MscL channel, a bacterial mechanosensor that protects cells from osmotic lysis, is a model for stimulus transduction and has potential as a nanovalve in microelectronic and drug-delivery devices. This study investigated the function of its cytoplasmic bundle (CB), a key structural component. The results show that CB dissociation is not required for normal channel opening and conductance. Furthermore, shortening the linker between the transmembrane domain and the CB, or restricting it by cross-linking or coordinating it with heavy metals, was able to reduce the channel's conductance and modulate its mechanosensitivity. These findings demonstrate the stability of the CB during activation and offer reversible avenues for designing MscL sensors with tunable conductance, making them more versatile for nanotechnology applications.",6

This study investigates the interactions between the N-terminal helix (S1) and the region of TM2 close to the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), both essential for channel activation. The researchers used double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL and an in vivo disulfide trapping assay to map the protein interactions between S1 and TM2ci. Complementarily, using patch clamp experiments, they analyzed how these interactions change under different redox conditions during channel opening. The results indicate that oxidation of disulfide bonds in specific mutants can lock the channel in either a closed or sub-conducting state, suggesting a model for the coordinated dynamics of the S1 and TM2ci domains during the MscL activation process.",7
The MscS and MscL families of mechanosensitive channels act as microbial emergency release valves,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3430326/,"mscs, and, mscl, families, mechanosensitive, channels","Unicellular organisms, especially bacteria, require mechanisms to survive extreme changes in the osmolarity of their environment, which can cause excessive accumulation or loss of internal pressure. To prevent cell lysis due to a sudden decrease in external osmolarity, many bacteria possess mechanosensitive (MS) channels of the MscS and MscL families. These channels act as emergency valves that release cytoplasmic solutes, relieving internal pressure. Although bacteria are known to adapt to high osmolarity by accumulating solutes such as potassium glutamate, these adaptations make them vulnerable to hypoosmolarity. In the event of hypoosmotic shock, the cell experiences a massive influx of water that, if left unchecked, leads to lysis. The MscS and MscL channels, discovered 25 years ago, are crucial for maintaining the physical integrity of the cell, sensing membrane tension and opening to allow solute egress. MscL is a highly conserved channel that acts as a last-resort mechanism, while the MscS family is more diverse, and its homologs can be found in different organisms and organelles, with multiple members in a single genome, suggesting more varied or specific functions for different environmental signals.",7

This study, through the creation of chimeras, found that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly residue I49 in *E. coli* and its equivalent F47 in *S. aureus* at the lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, dramatically influences these characteristics. Mutations that swap these key residues between species significantly alter open time, with *E. coli* I49 correlating with longer openings and *S. aureus* F47 correlating with longer openings. aureus* with shorter openings. It is proposed that this site acts as a ""spring"" that adjusts resistance to stabilize open or closed channel structures.",7

The authors admit to having mistakenly uploaded an outdated, larger version of their genome assembly, which contained microbial contamination and may have contributed to the discrepancies. Despite this, they reanalyzed the data using three different approaches on independent assemblies and conclude that *H. dujardini* still shows a significantly elevated level of genes of external origin compared to other animals. They argue that these genes are not mere contaminants, as they are found in scaffolds alongside tardigrade genes and show robust coverage across multiple datasets. Furthermore, they point out that the lack of expression of some of these genes in the RNA-Seq data does not rule out HGT, as many transferred genes are expressed at low levels or not at all. They acknowledge that the inferred HGT level is higher than in most animals, although not as high as their original conclusion, and they value the contributions of other groups to advance our understanding of the genome.",7

Although CAHS proteins are known to confer dehydration tolerance in tardigrades and other organisms, it was unclear whether they could protect mammalian cells from hyperosmotic stress. Using live-cell imaging in mammalian cells, the researchers demonstrated that expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 enhances cellular resilience to hyperosmotic conditions. These findings deepen our understanding of anhydrobiosis and suggest the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.",6

It was shown that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicative of oxidative stress, increases significantly over time in anhydrobiosis. Using RNA interference, glutathione peroxidase was identified as vital for survival during dehydration and rehydration, and glutathione reductase, catalase, and aquaporins 3 and 10 were important during the rehydration phase.

For 21 days, female mice were exposed to loads of 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of their body weight, including total hindlimb unloading (HLU) and control groups. The results showed that changes in bone and muscle were generally proportional to the degree of unloading, with a linear relationship observed in bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, and femoral microarchitecture. Even a load reduction to 70% resulted in significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. The PWS model was shown to be effective in applying controlled, reduced loads over the long term, producing predictable adaptive changes in hindlimb muscles and bones.",8

The results showed that the EIM phase slope parameter was significantly decreased in the spaceflight and HLU groups compared to their controls. This parameter also correlated with muscle fiber size and bone mineral density. This suggests that EIM is a useful, noninvasive tool for assessing muscle disuse caused by immobilization or microgravity.",8

Analyzing data from International Space Station (ISS) mice sacrificed in orbit, unlike previous studies involving the stress of returning to Earth, abnormal lipid accumulation was found in the livers of all space mice, regardless of strain or duration of exposure (weeks to months). Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed the activation of lipotoxic pathways, such as increased lipid and fatty acid metabolism. These data conclude that the activation of lipotoxic pathways is a direct consequence of spatial stressors, and this activation occurs in diverse genetic backgrounds. If similar responses occur in humans, this could lead to the development of liver disease, warranting further investigation.",7

An increase in the abundance of transcripts such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51 was identified, suggesting their role in the response of cortical bone to altered mechanical loading, potentially through mechanisms related to cellular energy balance and mitochondria. The findings demonstrate that an unbiased transcriptomic approach can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes, potentially leading to new targets for preventing disuse-induced osteoporosis.",8

The findings revealed plastic changes in the snails' vestibular system in response to spaceflight and the absence of light during the mission. Readaptation to normal tilt responses was observed approximately 20 hours after their return to Earth, concluding that, despite the permanence of gravity in their evolution, snails respond compensatorily to its loss and readapt when it is restored.",9

Coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi, exporting newly synthesized cargo, while coat protein complex I (COPI) facilitates retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, retrieving ER-resident proteins, lipids, and essential trafficking machinery. Both processes are interdependent, and their regulation is crucial for maintaining organelle homeostasis and the efficiency of the secretory pathway. The organization of the ER-Golgi interface and the regulation of COPII vary across species and cell types, displaying great plasticity to adapt to different cargo demands.

IRE1: ER stress sensor and cell fate executor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3818365/,ire1 stress sensor and cell fate,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a crucial cellular mechanism that, activated by transmembrane sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) such as the enzyme IRE1, monitors protein folding capacity and maintains homeostasis. IRE1 acts as a vital sensor in eukaryotes, triggering an adaptive response through the unconventional splicing of transcription factors (such as Xbp-1 in mammals) to increase protein folding capacity and promote cell survival. However, under conditions of irremediable ER stress, IRE1 reveals itself as a master regulator of cell fate, repressing adaptive responses and initiating apoptosis through regulated RNA degradation (RIDD), which includes the elimination of anti-apoptotic microRNAs, leading to the activation of Caspase-2. Unlike other UPR sensors such as PERK (unique to animals) and ATF6 (with homologs in plants), recent studies redefine IRE1 as a persistent and active executor in determining cell fate, capable of directing both adaptation and cell death under prolonged ER stress.",7

ER stress was shown to induce downregulation of auxin sensors (TIR1/AFBs) and transporters (PIN family), resulting in an increase in AUX/IAA proteins. A mutant of the ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in auxin response and levels, suggesting that IRE1 is essential for auxin homeostasis. Furthermore, UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, such as PIN5. These findings imply that the UPR in plants has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy to coordinate ER function with physiological processes.",6

Surprisingly, complete deletion of XyG in these mutants restores near-normal growth, suggesting that the presence of dysfunctional XyG is more detrimental than its total absence. Growth was also restored by modifying the structure of the dysfunctional XyG by duplicating the galactosylated side chains. This study underscores the importance of galactosylation for the normal function of XyG and demonstrates that alterations in the structure of its side chains disrupt various cellular and physiological processes.",7

Plants also possess membrane-anchored bZIP transcription factors (AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP17), whose proteolytic activation is similar to that of metazoan ATF6, displaying both overlapping and specialized functions. Although PERK-like activity has been detected, a specific PERK protein has not yet been identified in plants. Furthermore, NAC transcription factors, unique to plants, participate in the UPR, relocating from the ER or plasma membrane to the nucleus.

Unlike animal cells, plants have mobile Golgi stacks that move along the ER and a narrow interface, making it difficult to identify transport vectors. Although the role of COPII and COPI proteins in anterograde and retrograde transport is generally accepted in eukaryotes, the existence of COPII vesicles in plants is the subject of considerable debate, and their visualization is rare. The article brings together the divergent opinions of four leading cell biologists: Federica Brandizzi introduces the molecular context, Chris Hawes presents evidence in favor of tubules, David Robinson argues for vesicular transport, and Akihiko Nakano explores alternatives. The distinctive mobility of the Golgi in plants and the dynamics of ER exit sites (ERES) contribute to the complexity of this issue, preventing experts from reaching a consensus on how this essential transport occurs.",7
Pectin methylesterification impacts the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902601/,"pectin, methylesterification, impacts, relationship, between, photosynthesis","This study investigates how pectin methylesterification, regulated by the CGR2 and CGR3 genes, affects leaf architecture, carbon partitioning, and plant growth in Arabidopsis. It was shown that high levels of methylesterification (via CGR2 overexpression) result in expanded leaves, increased intercellular air space, and increased plant dry weight, while reduced methylesterification (in the cgr2/3 mutant) causes a dense, thin leaf mesophyll, limiting CO2 diffusion and decreasing growth. Growth differences are attributed to altered carbon partitioning toward leaf surface area and leaf mass per unit area, rather than to variations in the photosynthetic rate per unit area. RGC-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor by modulating cell expansion and positioning in leaves, which in turn directs carbon partitioning.",7
Reduced Chloroplast Coverage genes from Arabidopsis thaliana help to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4776492/,Reduced chloroplast coverage genes from Arabidopsis,"The text describes research on a small gene family called REC (REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE) in the plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. These genes are critical for determining the proportion of cell volume devoted to chloroplasts. It is shown that this mechanism is extraplastidial, as the REC1 protein, the major contributor, is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its movement between them could regulate this process. Deleting these genes significantly reduces chloroplast volume. It is suggested that a deeper understanding of this mechanism could allow manipulation of chloroplast size to improve photosynthetic efficiency and crop yield.",7
Maintaining the factory: The roles of the unfolded protein response in cellular homeostasis in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5415411/,maintaining factory roles unfolded protein response,"The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a set of signaling mechanisms essential for plants, allowing them to adapt and survive environmental stress. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a key cellular ""factory"" for protein folding, can accumulate misfolded proteins under stress, causing damage. The UPR detects these proteins and activates signaling cascades (involving IRE1, bZIP28, and bZIP60 in plants) to increase the ER's folding capacity and restore homeostasis. This process is critical for growth, development, and the response to various stresses (heat, pathogens, heavy metals, etc.). The research seeks to understand how the UPR integrates into plant physiology to improve crop productivity under adverse conditions.",7
NADPH oxidase activity is required for ER stress survival in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289879/,nadph oxidase activity required for stress,"In eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) mitigates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. While in mammals and yeast, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, this relationship has been unclear in plants. This study demonstrates that in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHD and RBOHF) contribute to ROS production during ER stress and are required for a proper adaptive UPR, helping the plant overcome temporary and chronic ER stress conditions. These results assign a cytoprotective role to ROS generated by RBOH in the defense against proteotoxic stress, suggesting a specific plant characteristic in the management of UPR. The research used nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) staining for superoxide and developed a fluorimetric method with Amplex Ultra Red for the quantification of H2O2, validating the involvement of RBOHD and RBOHF in ROS production.",6
Relevance of the Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987364/,"relevance, unfolded, protein, response, spaceflight induced, transcriptional","This study investigated the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* grown on the International Space Station to understand its response to spaceflight stress. Gene expression was compared in wild-type plants and UPR-defective mutants in orbit and in ground-based controls. Results showed that in-orbit cultivation substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes. However, unlike ground-based conditions where expression varied between mutants, in space it was largely similar across all genotypes. This suggests that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the absence of UPR regulators, offering new insights into plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments.",8

Using improved bioinformatics, the study identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), finding that 32 of them significantly altered their abundance over time. This included depletion of beneficial species associated with anti-inflammation and insulin sensitivity, such as *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* and *Ruminococcus bromii*, and enrichment of other bacteria. Furthermore, 49 microbial species were observed to be shared between the astronauts and their habitat. These findings reveal microbiome alterations that correlate with the symptoms of gut inflammation and glucose dysregulation observed in astronauts, improving our understanding of how prolonged confinement affects human health and is vital for future space missions.",9

HZE radiation was found to cause more densely packed DNA damage and to have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) approximately 3:1 for root growth inhibition and 2:1 for loss of somatic heterozygosity compared to gamma rays. Defects in checkpoint and repair mechanisms increased sensitivity to both radiations, with the replication fork checkpoint (governed by ATR) playing a slightly larger role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis.",7

Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation mouse,"This study evaluated cytoskeletal protein and mRNA expression levels in cardiac and lung tissues from mice euthanized aboard the International Space Station (ISS) 37 days after a mission, in order to avoid the readaptation effects observed in previous research. The results indicated that while there were no changes in cytoskeletal protein content, significant modifications were observed in the mRNA expression levels of associated genes, which could be due to an increase in genome-wide methylation and a decrease in mRNA expression of the cytosine demethylase Tet2. This approach provides crucial data for developing methods to protect humans during long-duration spaceflight and during readaptation to Earth's gravity.",9
Toward countering muscle and bone loss with spaceflight: GSK3 as a potential target,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10285634/,toward countering muscle and bone loss,"Exposure to spaceflight causes significant musculoskeletal impairment in mice, characterized by muscle atrophy and bone loss. This study investigated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a negative regulator of muscle and bone mass, as a potential therapeutic target. After approximately 30 days in space, murine soleus muscles showed a reduction in GSK3Î² content, linked to a shift from slow to fast twitch muscle fibers. In contrast, GSK3 activation in bone increased after spaceflight. In simulated microgravity models (hindlimb unloading), muscle-specific deletion of Gsk3 (GSK3mKD) in mice resulted in increased muscle mass, preservation of muscle strength, promotion of a type of oxidative fiber, and, notably, an increase in bone mineral density. These findings suggest that GSK3 inhibition is a promising strategy to counteract the loss of musculoskeletal health during spaceflight.",9
Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"spaceflight, increases, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, ca2, leak","A study investigated whether the antioxidant BuOE could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA pump dysfunction in the soleus muscles of mice exposed to 35 days in microgravity. The results showed that spaceflight induced significant soleus muscle atrophy, increased Ca2+ leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and elevated levels of an oxidative stress marker (4-HNE). Although BuOE increased SERCA's affinity for Ca2+, it failed to mitigate the muscle atrophy, Ca2+ leakage, and increased 4-HNE caused by microgravity. Therefore, it is concluded that BuOE is not effective in counteracting these effects, and alternative therapies are suggested.",8
Cardiovascular progenitor cells cultured aboard the International Space Station exhibit altered developmental and functional properties,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062551/,cardiovascular progenitor cells cultured aboard international,"study investigated the effects of spaceflight on human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs), both neonatal and adult, cultured on the International Space Station. Significant alterations in the expression of microRNAs and genes related to mechanotransduction, cytoskeletal organization, Wnt signaling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling were observed in both populations. Neonatal CPCs, in particular, displayed increased proliferative and regenerative potential, with elevated expression of early developmental markers and associated specific genes. These findings suggest that understanding these changes could inform new strategies for cardiac repair on Earth and for preserving astronaut health.",8

Pan-genome and functional analyses, desiccation resistance tests, and pathogenicity assays were performed on *Caenorhabditis elegans*. The findings revealed no distinctive signatures that differentiated pathogenic from commensal strains based solely on current resources, underscoring the need to complement information from databases with experimental evaluation of the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.",8
Evaluation of in vitro macrophage differentiation during space flight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570223/,"evaluation, vitro, macrophage, differentiation, during, space","This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on the in vitro differentiation of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells during the STS-126 mission at optimal physiological temperatures. During 14 days of flight, cells were differentiated in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and analyzed by flow cytometry and gene microarrays, comparing them with ground-based controls. The results showed significant differences in the number of macrophages developed in space and changes in the distribution of several cell surface molecules (such as CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C, and c-Fos). However, there were no changes in the expression of the c-Fms receptor, nor a consistent pattern of accelerated or delayed differentiation. The findings suggested relatively normal differentiation but increased proliferation of bone marrow macrophages, along with an unexpected influence of spaceflight on coagulation pathway genes. These data confirm that spaceflight affects the development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells in vitro.",7
Identification of critical host mitochondrion-associated genes during Ehrlichia chaffeensis infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457586/,identification critical host mitochondrion associated genes during,"This study identified host components crucial for the replication of *Ehrlichia chaffeensis*, the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. Through microarray analysis in *Drosophila melanogaster* S2 cells and screening of mutant flies, 10 genes were discovered whose mutation increased resistance to *Ehrlichia* infection, seven of which are associated with mitochondrial functions. Disruption of the human UCK2 gene was confirmed to affect bacterial replication in human macrophages, and experiments with inhibitors suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for *E. replication. chaffeensis*, providing nucleotides such as CTP, uridine and cytidine.",8
Ehrlichia chaffeensis replication sites in adult Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3558598/,ehrlichia chaffeensis replication sites adult drosophila,"This study investigated the replication of *Ehrlichia chaffeensis*, the bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis, in the arthropod model *Drosophila melanogaster*. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, the researchers silenced the genes *Uridine cytidine kinase 2* (*Uck2*) and *separation anxiety* (*san*) in specific fly tissues. They found that when *Uck2* or *san* were suppressed in hemocytes (equivalent to mammalian macrophages) or the fat body (a homolog of the liver), *E. chaffeensis* replication was significantly decreased and infections were less severe. However, silencing these genes in other tissues such as the eyes, wings, or salivary glands did not affect fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. The data suggest that, as in vertebrate hosts, *E. chaffeensis* replicates in the hemocytes and fat body of *Drosophila*, identifying key locations for host-pathogen interactions in arthropods.",6
Development and characterization of two porcine monocyte-derived macrophage cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11046949/,Development and characterization of two porcine monocyte derived,"This study sought to identify natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties against African swine fever virus (ASFV), a serious threat to pig production with no effective vaccine, which induces a pathogenic ""cytokine storm."" After screening 297 compounds, five were identified that inhibited the cytopathic effect of ASFV in Vero cells. Of these, tetrandrine and berbamine displayed high anti-ASFV activity, inhibiting the early stages of infection and mitigating infection in porcine macrophages. Both compounds, especially tetrandrine, significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines during ASFV infection in these cells. The findings suggest that these dual-action natural compounds have potential as preventive and therapeutic agents by inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced inflammation.",7
Understanding macrophage differentiation during space flight: The importance of ground-based experiments before space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890248/,"understanding, macrophage, differentiation, during, space, flight","This study investigated macrophage differentiation from primary mouse bone marrow cells using two in vitro culture systems, the Techshot Cell Cult bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA), in preparation for spaceflight. Results showed that both the orientation (horizontal or vertical) and movement of the culture devices significantly impacted macrophage growth, recovery, and differentiation. Significantly higher cell recovery was observed in horizontal orientations and in rotated bioreactors (""carousels""), compared to static or vertically rotating devices (""wheels""), which is linked to a larger surface area for cell propagation. Furthermore, the phenotype of the resulting macrophages, including their size, granularity, and expression of differentiation markers, varied markedly across devices and configurations. This underscores that culture results are highly dependent on the device and its orientation, which is critical for accurately interpreting data from spaceflight experiments, given the previous inconsistency observed in microgravity research.",8
Bone marrow leptin signaling mediates obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868799/,"bone, marrow, leptin, signaling, mediates, obesity associated","This study investigated the role of leptin signaling in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. Using chimeric mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and fed a high-fat diet, the researchers found that mice with db/db bone marrow (WT/db) had significantly lower body weight and adiposity. Furthermore, these mice exhibited reduced inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue, fewer crown-like structures, and an anti-inflammatory phenotype in their adipose tissue macrophages, along with increased insulin sensitivity. The findings suggest that disruption of leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions and metabolic complications of obesity, establishing a novel mechanism in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and supporting the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.",9
Establishment and characterization of DB-1: a leptin receptor-deficient murine macrophage cell line,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960141/,establishment and characterization db 1 leptin receptor deficient,"The text describes the creation and characterization of DB-1, a novel leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line designed as a tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity. Leptin, an adipokine, is a key sensor of nutritional status and regulator of the immune system, and its receptor influences various immune cells. The DB-1 line was developed from bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice, differentiated and spontaneously immortalized. These cells are diploid, grow at a linear rate, are positive for macrophage markers (MAC-2 and F4/80), and possess phagocytic activity similar to that of primary macrophages. They respond to stimulation with interferon-? but not to leptin or to chemotaxis of adipocyte-conditioned media, confirming the absence of a functional leptin receptor. It is concluded that DB-1 is a reliable tool for studying the role of leptin or its receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune dysregulation.",7

The results showed uniform usage of V, D, and J gene segments among mouse groups, especially for the most abundant segments, but high diversity in the CDR3 amino acid sequences of B cells, confirming combinatorial diversity. A bias was also observed in the detected V gene segments based on their chromosomal location. This work provides an unbiased view of the antibody repertoire of these mice, useful as a reference for future research.",7

Using high-throughput sequencing, the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice on the International Space Station was compared with ground-based control mice. The results indicated that the usage of individual gene segments was similar between the two groups of animals. Although the combinations of gene segments and their splicing varied among animals, there were no significant differences between treatment groups. No increase in spontaneous somatic mutations was found. In conclusion, the data suggest that short-term space travel did not affect the B cell repertoire of the mice studied.",8

Using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices in five data sets from four experiments, the researchers observed a trend toward decreased Ab repertoire diversity as a result of spaceflight. However, they did not find the same decrease in their physiological microgravity model in the spleen or bone marrow, although the bone marrow did show a reduction in diversity following vaccination. Differences in Shannon indices were also detected between experiments and tissues, but no consistent pattern of CDR3 usage was found. Overall, the study was able to identify differences in Ab repertoire diversity between the experimental groups and tissues analyzed.",8

No differences were observed in ovarian estradiol levels, but progesterone levels were lower in the habitat and flight groups compared to baseline. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function did not show significant differences in expression. These findings suggest that females exposed to long-duration spaceflight likely maintain ovarian cyclicity and may remain fertile, which is crucial for astronaut health and future space research.",8
Effect of spaceflight on Pseudomonas aeruginosa final cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228280/,"spaceflight, pseudomonas aeruginosa, final cell density","This study investigated how microgravity during spaceflight affects the final cell density of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, exploring the influence of phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility. The results showed that *P. aeruginosa* grown in microgravity reached a higher final cell density compared to controls in normal gravity, but only when culture conditions combined low phosphate concentrations and low oxygen availability. Increasing the availability of either of these nutrients eliminated this difference, and bacterial motility did not show a significant effect. These findings suggest that the differences in bacterial cell density observed in space are due to the interaction between microgravity conditions and the availability of essential growth substrates, indicating that microbes under nutritional limitations could achieve higher cell densities in microgravity. The study also identified discrepancies between cell counting methods, attributing them to post-growth storage conditions.",8

Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was confirmed, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight. The study also found that the effects of spaceflight are more evident in isolated cells than in whole organs, and that the liver experiences more gene and protein expression changes. These findings highlight mitochondrial dysregulation as a key focus of space biology, essential for understanding and countering the risks of long-duration missions.",8

Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513672/,Dichotomous lymphatic transport with loss caveolae,"The study examined the impact of the absence of caveolae (mediated by caveolin-1) on lymphatic function. Although lymphatic vessel architecture remained unaltered, initial uptake of macromolecules into capillaries was significantly higher, and lymphatic endothelial cell permeability was also increased in caveolin-1-deficient mice. However, downstream transport to lymph nodes was dramatically reduced, which was attributed to a significant decrease in the physical contractility of the collecting lymphatic vessels. It was observed that nitric oxide synthase inhibition could partially restore this contractility ex vivo. These results demonstrate that, while caveolae loss increases lymphatic permeability, it compromises propulsion, revealing their fundamental role in regulating active lymphatic transport.",6
Fungal diversity differences in the indoor dust microbiome from built environments on Earth and in space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11126634/,"fungal, diversity, differences, indoor, dust, microbiome","This study compares the microbial (bacterial and fungal) communities present in dust from homes on Earth and on the International Space Station (ISS), as well as their response to high humidity conditions. Microbiomes were found to differ significantly between the two environments; homes on Earth harbor a greater diversity of fungi (465 OTUs) and bacteria (237 ASVs) than those on the ISS (102 OTUs and 102 ASVs, respectively). The dominant fungal communities also vary. Furthermore, exposure to high humidity caused substantial shifts in fungal composition on the ISS, with *Aspergillus* outcompeting other genera, while terrestrial communities remained more stable. Overall, diversity decreased at both locations with increasing humidity and exposure time. These findings are crucial for future spacecraft design, with the goal of maintaining healthy interior microbiomes that protect crew health, ship integrity, and planetary protection.",8

It was shown that even short exposures to high relative humidity facilitate rapid microbial growth and changes in community composition. Fungal growth was successfully modeled using the ""time-of-wetting"" framework, showing a significant increase in concentrations and a reduction in fungal diversity with increasing humidity. Although bacterial growth could not be modeled using the same framework, bacterial communities also showed changes and a decrease in diversity with increasing humidity. The results suggest that humidity conditions can predict changes in fungal growth on spacecraft, which is crucial for protecting astronaut health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection as human activity in space intensifies.",8
Aging and estrogen status: A possible endothelium-dependent vascular coupling mechanism in bone remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502426/,aging and estrogen status possible endothelium dependent,"This study investigated the relationship between aging- and menopause-associated bone loss and vascular endothelial dysfunction. The objective was to determine whether modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the main feeding artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) due to alterations in estrogen in young and old Fischer-344 rats. In young rats, ovariectomy (OVX) decreased vasodilation and BV/TV, effects that were restored with estrogen replacement. In aged rats, OVX did not affect vasodilation or BV/TV, but estrogen replacement significantly improved them. Furthermore, in aged animals with low estrogen levels, vasodilation correlated with BV/TV. These findings demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and bone volume, suggesting a possible coupling mechanism between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and bone remodeling.",8
Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856860/,chronic skeletal unloading rat femur mechanisms,"This study investigated the impact of chronic skeletal unloading on bone blood flow and the structure of the main feeding artery (PNA) of the femur in rats. After 7 or 14 days of hindlimb unloading, femoral perfusion was significantly lower and vascular resistance higher in rats unloaded during acute unloading compared with controls. Specifically, PNAs from rats unloaded for 14 days showed reduced intraluminal diameter and thinner medial walls. These structural remodelings in the PNA compensated for the initial decreases in shear stress and circumferential strain, normalizing them. The findings conclude that chronic skeletal unloading decreases the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and bone marrow during reloading, which is partially attributed to remodeling of bone's resistance vasculature.",8
Differential effects of aging and exercise on intra-abdominal adipose arteriolar function and blood flow regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615599/,Differential aging and exercise intra abdominal adipose,"This study investigated the impact of aging on adipose tissue (AT) blood flow during exercise and how chronic exercise training can mitigate these effects. It was hypothesized that advancing age would cause an increase in AT perfusion during exercise, associated with a decrease in vasoconstriction, and that exercise training would attenuate these alterations. To this end, young and old rats were divided into sedentary and trained groups, and blood flow and vasoconstrictor responses were measured. It was found that sedentary old rats showed increased AT blood flow during exercise, while young rats showed decreased blood flow. This difference was associated with reduced vasoconstriction in the resistance arteries of the AT in aged rats. However, exercise training restored a similar blood flow response between age groups during exercise and improved vasoconstriction in the AT arteries of trained aged rats. The results conclude that aging impairs the ability to increase vascular resistance in the AT during exercise due to decreased vasoconstriction, and that exercise training can improve vasoconstriction and mitigate these age-related alterations in AT blood flow regulation.",7
Effects of spaceflight and ground recovery on mesenteric artery and vein constrictor properties in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050424/,spaceflight and ground recovery mesenteric artery,"This study investigated the hypothesis that mouse mesenteric arteries and veins would exhibit decreased vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight, contributing to the orthostatic hypotension observed in astronauts. Mesenteric arteries and veins were isolated from female mice that flew on the STS-131, STS-133, and STS-135 missions, and from ground control mice. Vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine in arteries, and to NE in veins, were measured both immediately postflight and at 1, 5, and 7 days postlanding. The results showed a significant reduction in maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine in arteries immediately and 1 day after spaceflight. Furthermore, reduced levels of ryanodine receptor-3 (RyR-3) mRNA were found in arteries. Mesenteric veins also showed decreased constriction to NE after flight. The study concludes that the impaired post-spaceflight vasoconstriction occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism, and that these vascular changes could compromise blood pressure maintenance in astronauts during orthostatic stress.",8
"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: Implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659353/,"spaceflight induced, alterations, cerebral, artery, vasoconstrictor, mechanical","This study investigated the effects of 13 days of spaceflight on the cerebral arteries of mice to understand the alterations in cerebral blood flow in astronauts. Contrary to the hypothesis, the results showed that spaceflight reduced myogenic vasoconstriction and arterial stiffness, and increased the maximum diameter of cerebral arteries compared to ground-based controls. These modifications suggest a possible increase in cerebral blood flow during spaceflight, which could contribute to the increased intracranial pressure and visual acuity problems observed in astronauts. The research also highlighted that the effects of real microgravity on brain arteries in mice differed from those observed in simulated microgravity models in rats, prompting further comparative study in mice.",9

Effects of Skeletal Unloading on the Vasomotor Properties of the Rat Femur Principal Nutrient Artery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398884/,"skeletal, unloading, vasomotor, properties, rat, femur","This study investigated the effects of disuse (simulated by hindlimb unloading in rats) on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral main feeding artery (PNA), the major conduit of blood flow to the femur. Researchers sought to understand why disuse and spaceflight cause cardiovascular deconditioning and bone loss, with a reduction in bone perfusion. The results indicated that the vasoconstrictor capacity of the PNA was not increased in disused rats, but endothelium-dependent vasodilation (responsiveness to acetylcholine and flow-mediated vasodilation) was attenuated. Endothelium-independent vasodilation showed no changes. They concluded that the decrease in bone perfusion and increase in vascular resistance associated with disuse were not due to increased vasoconstriction, but rather to a reduction in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.",8
Type 2 diabetes alters bone and marrow blood flow and vascular control mechanisms in the ZDF rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379453/,type diabetes alters bone and marrow,"This study investigated whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, potentially affecting bone health. The responses of the main feeding artery of the femur to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in vitro, and regional vascular perfusion and conductance of bone and marrow in vivo were assessed in pre-diabetic, short-term, and long-term diabetic rats. Few changes in vasomotor responses were found in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic stages. However, in rats with long-term diabetes, endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation was reduced, vasoconstriction was enhanced, and regional vascular perfusion and conductance in bone and marrow were significantly decreased. These findings suggest that profound impairment of bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia observed in long bones with chronic T2DM.",9

The results showed that cerebral arteries from spaceflight mice exhibited decreased vasoconstriction (both through Ca2+ voltage-gated mechanisms and thromboxane A2 receptors), attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and a lower pressure-diameter relationship. No differences were found in elastin or collagen content or arterial wall structure. The findings suggest that microgravity attenuates vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory properties, which could limit vascular control of cerebral perfusion or affect the distribution of cerebral blood flow during stress.",10
Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964660/,"apollo, lunar, astronauts, show, higher, cardiovascular","recent study investigated mortality rates from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and accidents in astronauts, dividing them into three groups: those who had never flown, those who had only flown in low Earth orbit (LEO), and the Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to travel beyond Earth's magnetosphere. The findings revealed that the Apollo lunar astronauts had a CVD mortality rate 4–5 times higher than that of non-flying astronauts and those in LEO. To explore the underlying mechanism, a secondary study in mice demonstrated that simulated space irradiation induces sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, a known risk factor for arterial occlusive disease. These results suggest that exposure to deep space radiation could significantly increase the risk of CVD for astronauts, exceeding previous estimates.",9

Impact of Spaceflight and Artificial Gravity on the Mouse Retina: Biochemical and Proteomic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165321/,Impact spaceflight and artificial gravity mouse,"Astronauts have reported visual impairment during and after space missions. To investigate the causes, a study examined the ocular tissue of mice following a 35-day flight on the International Space Station. Mice exposed to microgravity showed significant apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells and alterations in the expression of proteins related to cell death, repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress. The application of artificial gravity during spaceflight mitigated these changes. These results suggest that spaceflight induces retinal damage that could affect visual acuity and the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier, increasing the risk of degeneration, and that artificial gravity offers protection against these effects.",9
Simulated microgravity induces regionally distinct neurovascular and structural remodeling of skeletal muscle and cutaneous arteries in the rat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339929/,"simulated, microgravity, induces, regionally, distinct, neurovascular","The study investigated the effects of hindlimb deconditioning (HU) on the structure, function, and sympathetic innervation of small arteries in rats. HU was found to induce contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb muscular arteries: forelimb arteries increased in diameter, the sural artery decreased in diameter, and the saphenous artery was unaffected. Maximal contractile responses to norepinephrine and serotonin increased in forelimb muscular arteries but decreased in hindlimb arteries, with no changes in cutaneous arteries. The saphenous artery showed increased sensitivity to vasoconstrictors, possibly due to a reduction in its sympathetic innervation density, which also impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction. These results suggest diverse vascular adaptations to simulated microgravity.",9
Spaceflight decelerates the epigenetic clock orchestrated with a global alteration in DNA methylome and transcriptome in the mouse retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220224/,"spaceflight, decelerates, epigenetic, clock, orchestrated, with","recent study investigated whether long-duration spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming or alters the epigenetic clock in the retina, due to the ocular abnormalities observed in astronauts. Using retinas from mice deployed to the International Space Station for 37 days, the researchers found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated, and that spaceflight caused global hypomethylation. The retinal epigenetic clock of the space mice was significantly decelerated. Although to a lesser extent, differentially expressed genes were also identified, and alterations were observed in several biological pathways related to retinal diseases such as macular degeneration, as well as in cellular connectivity and inflammation. These findings demonstrate that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, which could contribute to the etiology of ocular disorders among astronauts.",9
Development of otolith receptors in Japanese quail.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910419/,"development, otolith, receptors, japanese, quail","This study examined the morphological development of otolithic vestibular receptors in quail, a species that requires a rapidly functioning vestibular system at hatching. The investigation focused on epithelial growth, hair cell density and polarization, and afferent nerve innervation. The otolithic maculae showed exponential growth of their epithelial area until day 7 post-hatch (P7), with an increase in hair cell density dependent on their location. Stereocilia polarization began early (embryonic day E8), with the formation of investment zones. Afferent innervation progressed from small fibers with growth cones (E6) to the formation of bouton terminals (E8), the appearance of goblet terminals (E10), and complete maturation of goblet and dimorphic terminals (E12–E14). In adults, goblet and dimorphic afferents were found mainly in the estrola, whereas bouton fibers were located in the extrastrola, exhibiting different innervation complexities. The study used scanning electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and neural tracing for comprehensive morphological characterization.",6

Using discrete rotational and translational stimuli, the response components of the neurons were characterized. It was found that although signals from the canals and otoliths converged and exhibited properties similar to individual afferent responses, neither a single component nor a simple linear combination of the two was sufficient to predict net neuronal responses during the combined stimulation. This suggests a complex integration of vestibular information in the brainstem.",6
Bone remodeling is regulated by inner ear vestibular signals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615562/,bone remodeling regulated inner ear vestibular,"This study investigated the role of the CaV1.2 calcium channel in regulating bone remodeling in the auditory ossicles and otic capsule, structures essential for hearing and balance. Decreased osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in these areas is known to contribute to otosclerosis, a common cause of deafness. The researchers used Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice with increased CaV1.2 channel function to direct increased Ca2+ signaling in osteochondral/osteoblastic progenitors in the ear. The results showed that these mice developed osteopetrosis in the ear bones, exhibiting fewer osteoclasts and elevated OPG expression, suggesting both anti-catabolic and anabolic effects. Furthermore, they exhibited hearing loss and balance defects. These findings confirm that CaV1.2-mediated Ca2+ influx promotes OPG expression, influencing ear bone remodeling and auditory and vestibular functions, offering new insights into the pathological mechanisms of otosclerosis and potential therapeutic strategies.",7

Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived OLPs were flown to the International Space Station for 38 days. The results showed that most space-borne OLPs divided more than ground-based controls, although a subpopulation exhibited significantly increased autophagic cell death. Proteomic analysis of the secretome of space-borne OLPs revealed a notable enrichment of the stress protein HSP-90Î² and SPARC, the latter known to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.

Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491145/,"genetic, dissection, arabidopsis, spaceflight, transcriptome, are","The CARA experiment, conducted on the International Space Station, investigated the adaptation of *Arabidopsis* plants to the space environment, focusing on whether the observed transcriptomic responses are necessary or if some are non-adaptive and costly. Comparing root tips of two *Arabidopsis* ecotypes (Col-0 and WS) and a Col-0 PhyD mutant, the study found that the PhyD mutant and the WS genotype exhibited significantly reduced transcriptomic responses in space under ambient light. This suggests that manipulating a single gene or the genotype can enhance adaptation by reducing the physiological cost. Furthermore, the space lighting environment influenced the magnitude of these responses, indicating that genetic and local habitat manipulations could substantially reduce the metabolic cost of adapting to spaceflight. The study raises the possibility that, in an environment outside their evolutionary history, plants may activate non-adaptive responses that could be genetically eliminated without compromising survival.",9

Utilization of singleâ€šÃ„Ãªimage normalized difference vegetation index (SIâ€šÃ„ÃªNDVI) for early plant stress detection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6201722/,"utilization, single, image, normalized, difference, vegetation","This paper describes the development and validation of a single-image normalized difference vegetation index (SI-NDVI) imaging system for the early and cost-effective detection of plant stress under controlled conditions, such as indoor agriculture. Unlike traditional NDVI, which uses red light, SI-NDVI compares leaf reflectance in the blue and near-infrared (NIR) light spectra. The system uses a commercial camera modified with a special filter to capture both spectra in a single image, simplifying the process and reducing costs. Images are analyzed with open-source software and spreadsheets to generate qualitative (false-color images) and quantitative (graphs) representations. SI-NDVI was shown to detect stress in *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings and *Eruca sativa* plants within 15 minutes of stressor application (salinity, ammonium nitrate), well before it was visible to the naked eye. This technology offers a more accessible, cost-effective, and user-friendly tool than traditional NDVI or hyperspectral methods for monitoring plant health.",7

Roots were sectioned into two regions to compare differential gene expression. Both methods were found to be applicable to small samples, identifying 4,180 genes with differential expression between regions. RNA-Seq detected 771 unique genes and 19 novel regions not found by microarrays, but the microarrays identified spaceflight-relevant genes that RNA-Seq missed. The research concludes that root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis with either technique, although RNA-Seq may miss some gene expression changes important for the space environment, suggesting the need to improve the techniques for small and rare samples.",8

Root skewing-associated genes impact the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064724/,"root, skewing associated, genes, impact, spaceflight, response","The APEX-03-2 study investigated the contribution of the SPIRAL1 (SPR1) and SKU5 genes to root behavior and gene expression in Arabidopsis under microgravity. Although previously thought to be gravity-dependent, root skewing occurs in space, suggesting that root morphology and cell wall remodeling are key to physiological adaptation. SPR1 is involved in directional cell expansion and microtubule dynamics, while SKU5 is a protein anchored to the plasma membrane and cell wall, linked to signaling stress responses. *spr1* and *sku5* mutants exhibited markedly different twisting behaviors and gene expression patterns in space. *spr1* mutants showed fewer differentially expressed genes than the wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts adaptation to spaceflight. In contrast, *sku5* mutants had significantly more differentially expressed genes, indicating a more complex stress response and the importance of SKU5 function for proper adaptation. Developmental age also had a significant influence, especially in *sku5* plants. These findings demonstrate that the torsional pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 make unique and opposing contributions to spatial physiological adaptation.",8
Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond differently to extended microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379395/,Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond,"study investigated the effects of 30 days of microgravity in mice, observing pathological changes in articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC). The AC of in-flight mice showed evidence of degradation, with loss of proteoglycans and reduced matrix protein expression, in addition to surface damage and osteophyte formation. In contrast, the SC showed no signs of deterioration or changes in gene expression suggestive of degradation. The findings indicate that the AC, a weight-bearing tissue, is negatively affected by microgravity unloading, while the SC, which receives a constant minimal load (from breathing), is not. This suggests that the response of cartilage tissue to microgravity depends on the biomechanical environment to which it is normally adapted, and it is proposed that maintaining physiological loading on the AC during spaceflight could minimize its damage.",8
Host-microbe interactions in microgravity: assessment and implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187166/,"host microbe, interactions, microgravity, assessment, and, implications","Spaceflight imposes unique stresses such as microgravity, which alters host-microbiome interactions crucial to health. Microgravity affects the physiology and genetics of plants and animals, causing effects ranging from bone loss in humans to increased susceptibility to pathogens. Although general effects have been observed in hosts, the impact on their microbiomes is still under investigation. Microgravity has been shown to increase the virulence and resistance of some pathogens such as Salmonella by altering their gene expression, although decreased virulence has been observed in other cases. Research into these phenomena is conducted both in realistic microgravity environments and in Earth-based simulations, such as rotating-wall bioreactors.

Environmental cues and symbiont microbe-associated molecular patterns function in concert to drive the daily remodeling of the crypt-cell brush border of the Euprymna scolopes light organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5219934/,environmental cues and symbiont microbe associated molecular,"The text describes how the microbiota influences the brush border microarchitecture of host epithelial tissues, using the squid-Vibrio symbiotic system. A daily effacement of microvilli is observed at dawn, coinciding with the expulsion of symbionts, and a subsequent repolarization with an increase in microvilli density. The investigation reveals that effacement is triggered by an environmental light signal and occurs independently of the presence of symbionts. Furthermore, the increase in microvillar density and repolarization after dawn require the presence of symbionts and are specifically induced by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A from symbiont cells. These findings demonstrate that the brush border is shaped by a combination of environmental and microbial cues, with microbe-associated molecular patterns playing a crucial role in regulating its microarchitecture.",8

These novel microsyntenies form topological compartments with distinct regulatory structures and contribute to complex expression patterns. Microsyntenies associated with cephalopodal innovations (MACIs) enriched in nervous system expression were identified, suggesting that they were fundamental to their evolution. The study also noted larger and more variable topologically associated domains (TADs) in squid compared to humans, and proposes that microsynthetic profiling is key to understanding cephalopod innovations.",8

The objectives included achieving cartilage-like mechanical properties, demonstrating cartilage formation by hMSCs on the scaffolds, and analyzing the impact of scaffold structure (loosely woven vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static vs. rocking bioreactor), and medium composition. The results showed that constructs with tightly woven PCL scaffolds cultured in bioreactors achieved aggregate modules close to normal articular cartilage. The bioreactors produced constructs with higher collagen content and a more homogeneous matrix, while chondrogenic additives increased glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and early collagen II messenger RNA expression, especially without serum. Chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline matrix that immunostained for type II but not type I collagen.

Bone marrow hMSCs were seeded on PCL scaffolds and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days, under chondrogenic or osteogenic conditions. In chondrogenic medium, cartilage tissue was formed by day 21, with hypertrophic mineralization observed at the interface with the scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, as well as alkaline phosphatase activity, depended on culture duration and additives, showing significant interactive effects. The 45-day-old constructs exhibited mechanical properties similar to native articular cartilage and gene expression characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation. In contrast, the osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. These findings suggest that long-term culture of hMSCs on 3D scaffolds under chondrogenic conditions results in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization, which is relevant for graft development in the repair of osteochondral defects.",10

Asparagine biosynthesis as a mechanism of increased host lethality induced by Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111996/,asparagine biosynthesis mechanism increased host lethality,"This study investigates how simulated microgravity (LSMMG) increases the virulence of the opportunistic bacterium *Serratia marcescens*, a pathogen relevant to astronaut health. The findings show that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in *S. marcescens*, leading to a significant increase in host (*Drosophila melanogaster*) mortality. This effect is reproduced by adding aspartate and glutamine, precursors of asparagine, and is associated with overexpression of the *asnB* gene (asparagine synthase B) in the bacterium. Although accelerated bacterial growth contributes, the combination of aspartate and glutamine is required for maximum lethality and overexpression of key genes in the asparagine pathway. Furthermore, L-asparaginase, which breaks down asparagine, was identified as able to mitigate LSMMG-induced virulence, offering a potential countermeasure strategy. The research highlights the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway for understanding the molecular mechanisms of virulence in microgravity and developing solutions.",9

The causative gene was found to be COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1), which encodes an EIN3-binding F-box protein (OsEBF1). The absence of OsCRW1 amplifies ethylene signaling through the OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module, resulting in overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the root tip. This, in turn, compromises root cap stability, the polar localization of OsPIN2, and the symmetrical distribution of auxin, thereby impairing gravitropic growth.

The latter are essential for immediate responses, such as defense against herbivores or rapid movements in plants like the Dionea flytrap and Mimosa pudica, where action potentials and variations, and even hydraulic pressure changes, allow the transmission of information at speeds that far exceed chemical transport. Current research focuses on unraveling the molecular machinery, such as ion channels and enzymes, that underpin this vital communication network.",6

To address this, Rad-Bio-App, a web-based database that imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA's GeneLab repository, has been developed. This tool allows users, including non-specialists, to visualize, filter, and compare dosimetry and other metadata, facilitating understanding of the impact of radiation on organisms in the space context and supporting scientific research.",8
The vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 participates in submergence and anoxia stress responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9706465/,vacuolar transporter cax1 participates submergence and,"This study demonstrates that mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking the CAX1 gene (cax1) exhibit significantly increased tolerance to anoxic conditions and submergence compared to wild-type plants. The cax1 mutants exhibit increased survival, reduced chlorophyll loss, and improved recovery following oxygen deprivation. Investigations revealed that this tolerance is associated with altered metabolic processes, decreased post-anoxic reactive oxygen species production, and changes in hormonal and calcium signaling. These findings suggest that the CAX1 anoxia-response pathway could be genetically modified to improve crop resistance to the adverse effects of flooding.",7
Meta-analysis of the space flight and microgravity response of the Arabidopsis plant transcriptome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027818/,"meta analysis, space, flight, and microgravity response","This study reanalyzed fifteen *Arabidopsis thaliana* spaceflight experiments from NASA's GeneLab repository, employing a standardized computational pipeline and a curated metadata matrix. The research sought to understand plant responses to a complex space environment, including altered gravity and radiation. Findings revealed that factors such as the type of analysis (microarray vs. RNA-seq) and hardware or environmental conditions have a significant confounding effect, often surpassing the impact of spaceflight itself on gene expression patterns. Despite this, the standardized approach and metadata matrix allowed for the identification of known responses, such as oxidative stress, and the discovery of new response elements, such as COR78 gene expression, improving the robustness of comparisons between different plant transcriptomic datasets across space.",9

The study demonstrated that acute exposure to 100 cGy of gamma radiation accelerated changes in cancellous bone, such as decreased trabecular number and connectivity, with changes observed within one month similar to those seen in four months of natural aging. However, doses of 1 cGy or 10 cGy had no significant effects, and radiation did not affect bone cell differentiation ex vivo.",7
Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490751/,Ionizing radiation stimulates expression of pro osteoclastogenic genes,"Total body irradiation, whether by gamma rays or heavy ions, causes rapid bone mineral loss and an increase in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. A study in mice showed that radiation exposure induces a rapid and persistent increase in the expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokine Rankl and other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in bone marrow cells, which precedes and overlaps with an increase in bone resorption markers. This results in a net pro-resorptive balance and a 16% decrease in cancellous bone after one week, contributing to the rapid and progressive deterioration of bone microarchitecture.",8
Preservation of Multiple Mammalian Tissues to Maximize Science Return from Ground Based and Spaceflight Experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132293/,"preservation, multiple, mammalian, tissues, maximize, science","This study aimed to optimize rodent tissue collection and preservation methods for experiments, especially in resource-limited settings such as spaceflight. The impact of post-euthanasia collection time, preservation methods, and storage duration on RNA quality and enzymatic activity in tissues such as liver and spleen was investigated, as well as the feasibility of dissecting multiple tissues from frozen cadavers. The results showed that fresh tissues could be collected up to one hour after euthanasia and stored for up to 11 months at -80°C with minimal effects on RNA quality from livers and spleens preserved in RNAlater. Liver enzyme activity remained similar to that of controls. The quality of RNA from liver, heart, and kidneys of cadavers frozen for up to 7 months was minimally affected, although other tissues such as small intestine and bone marrow showed earlier degradation. It is concluded that the developed protocols allow obtaining high-quality samples for RNA and some protein expression analysis, even with delayed preservation or prolonged storage, which is highly relevant for both ground-based experiments with sampling limitations and space missions.",9
Hindlimb Unloading: Rodent Analog for Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11747068/,hindlimb unloading rodent analog for microgravity,"This study used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cellular atlas of the carotid and femoral arteries of rats subjected to three months of hindlimb unloading, a model that simulates microgravity. The objective was to understand the cell populations, dysregulated genes, cell communication, and key transcription factors involved in vascular remodeling caused by prolonged spaceflight. The findings revealed an increased percentage of endothelial cells in the carotid artery and a decrease in smooth muscle cells in both arteries following the simulation. Dysregulated genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and vasoconstriction were identified, with notable variability in fibroblasts, and enhanced intercellular interactions were observed, especially between smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Furthermore, several influential transcription factors were predicted. This work provides the first cellular atlas of conduit arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, offering a valuable reference for future research on vascular deconditioning in space.",7
Redox Signaling and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666834/,redox signaling and its impact on skeletal,"The text examines how microgravity and radiation in space affect the mammalian skeleton and vasculature, highlighting the role of oxidative stress and redox signaling in tissue dysfunction. Microgravity is observed to contribute to osteopenia and vascular alterations, while ionizing radiation damages DNA and cells. In both astronauts and animal models, changes in redox status are evident, with increased oxidative damage and decreased antioxidant defenses during and after spaceflight, impacting bone, heart, liver, and eye health. Altered nitric oxide bioavailability, crucial for vascular function and bone remodeling, is a key mechanism. Understanding these effects is essential for developing interventions to mitigate spaceflight-induced deficits.",7
Influence of social isolation during prolonged simulated weightlessness by hindlimb unloading,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6753329/,"influence, social, isolation, during, prolonged, simulated","This study investigated the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses in mice subjected to a hindlimb unloading (HU) model, which simulates weightlessness. To do so, the traditional HU system was modified to allow for social pair housing and compared mice housed individually and socially for 30 days. The results showed that expected musculoskeletal deficits were similar in both social environments. However, immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were influenced by the social environment: unloading reduced CD4+ T cells in individual mice but not in social mice, and increased adrenal gland mass in social mice, an effect also observed for social isolation itself. The authors conclude that musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are consistent, but combined stressors may mask or differentiate other biological responses.",7
Validation of a new Rodent experimental System to investigate consequences of Long Duration Space Habitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012842/,"validation, new, rodent, experimental, system, investigate","The text describes NASA's Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) experiment, the primary objective of which was to establish a new capability to conduct long-term studies with rodents in space and to retrieve samples in situ in orbit, avoiding the confounding factors associated with return to Earth. Female mice were housed on the International Space Station for 21/22 or 37 days in microgravity, where they were euthanized and their tissues (livers and spleens) dissected. The mice remained healthy, showed increased physical activity, and those exposed for 37 days showed increased liver mass and enzyme activity, with the expected atrophy of the soleus muscle. The quality of the RNA and enzymatic activity of the samples was acceptable, validating the system for long-term experiments and sample recovery in orbit without inducing chronic stress.",10
Skeletal tissue regulation by catalase over-expression in mitochondria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405755/,"skeletal, tissue, regulation, catalase, over expression, mitochondria","This study investigated disuse-related muscle atrophy in fast-twitch muscles, such as the gastrocnemius, and determined that mitochondrial dysfunction—manifested by defective fusion and compromised OXPHOS capacity—rather than oxidative stress, triggers muscle loss by activating the AMPK pathway. It was shown that overexpression of PGC-1 prevented atrophy by maintaining mitochondrial fusion proteins and inhibiting AMPK pathway activation and catabolic factor expression. This suggests that compounds that induce PGC-1Î± could be useful for treating and preventing muscle atrophy in fast-twitch muscles.",7
Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria mitigates changes in hippocampal cytokine expression following simulated microgravity and isolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260663/,"overexpression, catalase, mitochondria, mitigates, changes, hippocampal","This study examined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity, individually or in combination, on the hippocampal inflammatory cytokine profile in mice, replicating spaceflight and prolonged rest conditions. Both isolation and simulated microgravity were found to regulate distinct repertoires of inflammation-associated cytokines in the hippocampus, and their combined effects were not additive. Mice genetically engineered to reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MCAT) showed protection against these isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes. These findings suggest a crucial role for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in neuroinflammatory responses and highlight the importance of mitigating these species to protect the central nervous system during prolonged space exploration and other situations of isolation or inactivity on Earth.",8

Kae1 is mentioned as a central factor in its biosynthesis, previously studied in unicellular organisms. This study investigated the Kae1 ortholog in *Drosophila melanogaster*, isolating an allelic series of *kae1* mutants that exhibited decreased t6A, growth defects, developmental delay, and melanotic masses. The requirement for t6A was found to be tissue-specific in metazoans, affecting mitotic tissues more than non-proliferating ones, and *kae1* acts as a tumor suppressor in larval hematopoietic tissue. These findings reveal the complexity of the biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification in animal development and disease.",8
Novel Organelles with Elements of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Secretion Systems Weaponize Parasites of Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659752/,"novel organelles with elements, bacterial, and","The success of parasitoid wasps depends on strategies to counteract their hosts' defenses. While *Leptopilina boulardi* (Lb) activates the immunity of *Drosophila melanogaster*, *L. heterotoma* (Lh) actively suppresses it. Proteomic studies reveal that the virus-like particles (VLPs) in Lh venom, crucial for its parasitism, are not viral but contain eukaryotic vesicular transport, immunity, and other novel proteins. Some of these Lh-specific proteins, such as p40, show similarities to bacterial type 3 secretion systems. This suggests that Lh VLPs are a new class of extracellular organelles, termed ""Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles"" (MSEVs), that combine prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties for protein delivery and host immune suppression.",9
combined computational strategy of sequence and structural analysis predicts the existence of a functional eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372189/,"combined, computational, strategy, sequence, and, structural","This study challenges the current view that insects lack a functional eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway by investigating *Drosophila melanogaster* using systematic bioinformatics approaches. The researchers identified 20 candidate enzymes in the fruit fly that, although with low sequence identity to their human counterparts, demonstrated striking conservation in domain architecture, catalytic structure, and functional residues. Structural homology models were found for three fly cyclooxygenases, although no direct candidates for lipoxygenases were identified, suggesting the existence of a possible non-canonical pathway. The findings predict that the *D. melanogaster* likely encodes pathways for the synthesis of eicosanoids or similar biolipids, opening up new possibilities for studying the regulation of biological functions and inflammation in a model organism relevant to human health.",8
Immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded in the wasp genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945029/,"immune, suppressive, extracellular, vesicle, proteins, leptopilin","The research focused on mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs) from the parasitoid wasp *Leptopilina heterotoma*, which suppress the immunity of its *Drosophila* host. An additional 246 proteins were identified in the MSEV proteome, adding to the 161 previously known. An enrichment analysis confirmed the vesicular nature of these structures, and sequencing of the *L. heterotoma* genome revealed that more than 90% of MSEV proteins are encoded within the wasp genome. These results explain the stable association and vertical inheritance of MSEVs with wasps and, while not ruling out a viral origin, suggest that they are specialized vesicles that transfer virulence factors. This contributes to our understanding of immune suppression strategies in wasps and the evolution of related species.",8
Spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase virulence of Serratia marcescens in the Drosophila melanogaster infection model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase,"study investigated the impact of the space environment on pathogenic bacteria, using the bacterium *Serratia marcescens* and the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model. *S. marcescens*, grown on the International Space Station or under simulated microgravity conditions on Earth, was found to become significantly more virulent and lethal to the flies, in addition to showing increased growth rates in vitro and in vivo at advanced stages. However, this increased virulence and growth were not persistent; they were reversed after the bacteria were recultured under normal Earth-based conditions, suggesting temporary physiological rather than genetic changes. The research also indicated that the increased virulence was due to alterations in the bacteria itself, and not primarily to changes in the host's immune system. These findings suggest that the space environment induces complex, reversible physiological changes in pathogens, increasing their pathogenicity.",10
parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/,parasitoid wasp drosophila employs preemptive and,"The parasitoid wasp Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) suppresses the immunity of its Drosophila host by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs) in its venom, loaded with immunosuppressive proteins. These EVs are distributed throughout the host's hemolymphatic system, specifically targeting the larval lymphatic gland, a hematopoietic organ. The EVs converge and dismantle the lymphatic gland's posterior signaling center (PSC), which is crucial for the differentiation of lamellocytes, the immune cells necessary to encapsulate the wasp's eggs. Lymphatic gland progenitors internalize EVs, which then damage the endosomal and phagolysosomal compartments, resulting in the destruction of both mature and immature blood cells. This multifaceted strategy allows the wasp to block host cellular immunity, eliminating existing defenses and preventing the production of new, protective immune cells. These findings suggest a previously unrecognized phagocytic role for the lymphatic gland and have implications for agricultural pest control and therapeutic development.",8
In Silico Analysis of a Drosophila Parasitoid Venom Peptide Reveals Prevalence of the Cationâ€šÃ„Ã¬Polarâ€šÃ„Ã¬Cation Clip Motif in Knottin Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9865768/,silico drosophila parasitoid venom peptide reveals,"This study focuses on the peptide LhKNOT, identified in the venom of the parasitoid wasp *Leptopilina heterotoma*, known to suppress immunity in *Drosophila* flies. Through proteomic and structural analysis, LhKNOT was found to be a knottin peptide containing a Cation-Polar-Cation (CPC) clip motif. This CPC clip motif, thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity and heparin binding, is present in a surprising majority of knottins studied, including the *Drosophila* antifungal peptide Drosomycin. The findings suggest a possible defensive or virulence function for LhKNOT in the wasp, contributing to host immune suppression. The prevalence of this CPC clip motif in the structure of knottins indicates its importance in the biochemical functions of these proteins, with implications for host-parasite interactions and drug design.",7
Drosophila parasitoids go to space: Unexpected effects of spaceflight on hosts and their parasitoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10797188/,"drosophila, parasitoids, space, unexpected, spaceflight, hosts","study investigated the effects of spaceflight on fruit flies (healthy and those with a tumor-predisposing mutation) and their natural parasitoid wasps. Healthy flies showed lower survival and increased sensitivity to spaceflight, with downregulation of many essential genes. Although overall survival was unaffected in the tumor-bearing mutant flies, they experienced increased tumor burden and activation of inflammation-related genes in space; these inflammatory genes were also activated in the healthy flies. In contrast, the parasitoid wasps proved more resilient, as their survival and virulence were not significantly affected, and mutants with visible alterations after flight were even isolated. The findings suggest that spaceflight alters host immunity and enhances tumor development in susceptible flies, while metazoan parasites maintain their infectivity and normal development, crucial data for future human space missions.",8

Results revealed that control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight, with lower survival and dysregulated essential genes, while mutant flies with tumors experienced increased tumor burden and activation of inflammation-related genes. Parasitoid wasps, in contrast, showed greater resilience; spaceflight did not significantly affect their survival or the expression of their virulence genes, although mutant wasps with visible post-flight alterations were isolated. These findings suggest that the spatial environment influences immune gene expression and tumor development in flies, but may have a limited impact on parasitoid virulence.",8
Simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic cells to simulated microgravity and radiation increases chromosome aberrations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555395/,simultaneous exposure cultured human lymphoblastic cells,"This study investigates the combined effects of simulated microgravity and space radiation on human TK6 lymphoblastic cells, a crucial factor for astronaut health on long-duration missions. Using a novel system with a 3D clinostat for simultaneous and continuous exposure to radiation (X-rays or carbon ions) and microgravity, researchers observed a higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations in cells exposed to both factors simultaneously, compared to those exposed to radiation alone. The results suggest that current risk assessments based on 1G conditions may underestimate potential health risks to astronauts, emphasizing the need for more data on cellular responses to irradiation under microgravity.",10

Colonies grown on agar were examined under spatial microgravity, rotation, and random positioning machine (RPM), as well as in nutrient-rich and -poor media. The results showed that the effects of random positioning differed from rotation, and that both real and simulated microgravity exacerbated cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were highly dependent on the response to shear stress, with each microgravity model exhibiting a unique response signature. These physical techniques allowed for the manipulation of ammonia convection and its signaling, which significantly contributes to the understanding of drug action mechanisms, cellular aging, and colony differentiation.",10

The results revealed both tissue-specific gene responses and common pathways activated in both organs. Specifically, both the liver and kidney showed overexpression of genes in four key areas: cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogenous compounds; apoptosis and cell death; fat cell differentiation; and downregulation of protein kinases. In addition, unique pathways were identified for each organ, such as T cell activation in the liver and peptide binding in the kidney.",7

The importance of calculating the dose of liposomal amphotericin B based on ideal body weight, not actual weight, for obese patients is highlighted, given the risk of nephrotoxicity. *C. albidus* central nervous system infections are uncommon but have a high mortality rate, and only nine cases have been reported in the literature. Risk factors include immunodeficiency and animal exposure, and accurate diagnosis often requires mass spectrometry. In the absence of established treatment guidelines, amphotericin B is recommended as initial therapy, along with susceptibility testing to optimize therapeutic decisions.",7
Endocrine Effects of Space Flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11833055/,"endocrine, space, flight","Space exploration and prolonged microgravity pose physiological challenges to astronauts, particularly affecting the central nervous system.

For eight weeks, mice in one group were exposed to simulated microgravity and subjected to behavioral testing, bone density analysis, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiome analysis. The results indicated that clinostat-treated mice showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in the brain transcriptome, and metabolic alterations in serum and gut microbiota. This model is considered valuable for studying microgravity-related neurological alterations, as it mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptomic changes and highlights the need to pay attention to emotional changes in space.",7
Role of shear stress on renal proximal tubular cells for nephrotoxicity assays,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146534/,"role, shear, stress, renal, proximal, tubular","This study investigated the effects of contrast medium (CM) viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) using a 3D ""kidney-on-a-chip"" model with proximal renal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) under fluid shear stress, compared with static conditions. The results showed that low-osmolar contrast medium (LOCM) exhibited a significantly greater dose-dependent cytotoxic effect than iso-osmolar contrast medium (IOCM) under static and low-to-moderate shear conditions. However, under high shear conditions, cell viability was also reduced with IOCM, with no differences found between LOCM and IOCM, as the high viscosity of IOCM slowed flow and increased shear stress. This suggests a vital role for viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear stress, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies, and proposes the ""kidney-on-a-chip"" model as an alternative for CIN research.",6

The study sought to determine the optimal concentration to ensure surgical field clarity and hemodynamic stability. The results showed no significant differences in surgical field clarity between groups. However, all concentrations increased hemodynamic parameters, with the highest concentrations (1:5000 and 1:10,000) having the most significant and lasting effect. Therefore, the use of lower concentrations (1:20,000 to 1:40,000) is recommended to minimize the impact on patient hemodynamics while maintaining satisfactory surgical clarity.",7
Back pain in space and post-flight spinal injury: Mechanisms and countermeasure development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339989/,"back, pain, space, and, post flight, spine","longitudinal study of six NASA astronauts on the International Space Station revealed that prolonged microgravity causes a decrease in lumbar lordosis and a reduction in active range of motion in the midlumbar discs. Most subjects experienced atrophy of the multifidus muscles, strongly correlated with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Only astronauts with preexisting vertebral endplate irregularities developed postflight lumbar symptoms, such as chronic pain or disc herniations. The findings suggest that multifidus atrophy, not disk swelling, is key to the biomechanical changes in the spine in space, increasing the risk of injury upon returning to gravity and offering valuable information for astronaut countermeasures and research on lower back pain on Earth.",8

Analyzing their skulls, a statistically significant increase in bone volume was found in the microgravity group, as well as a trend toward increased cross-sectional thickness, while tissue mineral density remained unchanged. These findings suggest that microgravity induces adaptive growth in cranial bones, possibly due to changes in fluid distribution, independent of skeletal loading.",7
Altered disc compression in children with idiopathic low back pain: an upright magnetic resonance imaging backpack study,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947616/,altered disc compression children with idiopathic,"study using upright MRI analyzed the response of the lumbar spine to backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) compared with that of healthy children. It was found that in children with ILBP, the 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks compressed only the L5-S1 intervertebral disc, unlike in healthy children, where compression was more widespread across other lumbar discs. Subjects with ILBP experienced significantly less disc compression at most lumbar levels (T12-L1 to L4-5) and less lumbar lordosis with increasing load, but reported significantly more pain, even preventing them from tolerating a 12 kg load. This suggests that children with ILBP may redistribute the load from the discs to the paraspinal muscles, causing muscle fatigue and increased pain.",7
Spaceflight-induced bone loss alters failure mode and reduces bending strength in murine spinal segments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477841/,"spaceflight induced, bone, loss, alters, failure, mode","This study investigated the effects of microgravity on the flexural properties of spinal discs, due to the fourfold increase in disc herniation in astronauts following spaceflight. Using caudal segments from mice exposed to 30 days of spaceflight and controls, microgravity was observed to significantly shorten the nonlinear region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduce flexural strength by 17%. Segments from flight mice tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, unlike controls, which failed at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight also reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness. These results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may impair the flexural properties of the spine and contribute to the increased risk of disc herniation in astronauts.",9
Spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse calvaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9139491/,Spaceflight associated vascular remodeling and gene expression,"This study investigated the effects of microgravity on vascular and bone remodeling in the skull of mice, a non-load-bearing region, during spaceflight. Comparing mice from 15- and 30-day missions with ground-based control groups, researchers observed a significant reduction in vessel diameter and increased capillarization after 15 days. After 30 days, although vessel number and diameter remained unchanged, significant increases in the expression of pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic (BMP-2) genes were detected. The results suggest that angiogenesis is key in regulating pathological bone growth in non-weight-bearing regions in microgravity, which has implications for the development of countermeasures in long-duration spaceflight.",8

Furthermore, it was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, but its resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5 did not change. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant alterations in gene expression, suggesting reduced translation, downregulation of metabolism, increased lipid degradation, and increased expression of chaperones and mycobactins. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor consistently induced by LSMMG. In summary, the study suggests that LSMMG could simulate a nutrient deprivation environment similar to that found in macrophages during infection, with SigH implicated in the transcriptomic response.",8
Effects of mechanostimulation on gravitropism and signal persistence in flax roots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258067/,"mechanostimulation, gravitropism and signal persistence flax","study examined the persistence of the gravitational signal and the distinction between mechanostimulation and gravistimulation in flax roots. The roots were reoriented and then subjected to vertical or horizontal clinorotation at different speeds. It was observed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect growth rate, whereas vertical clinorotation reduced it by 7%. The angular velocity of clinorotation did not influence growth, but it did influence curvature: horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with angular velocity, whereas vertical clinorotation decreased it, resulting in straight roots at 5 rpm. The gravitropic signal saturated after 10 minutes of reorientation and persisted for approximately 120 minutes. The results suggest that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the gravitropic response but does not affect the persistence of signal ""memory.""",7

This study examined the effectiveness of hydroconditioning, haloconditioning, and osmoconditioning in mitigating the effects of salinity (100 mM NaCl) on cauliflower. The results showed that salinity had significant deleterious impacts on seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, in addition to causing the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, the different conditioning strategies proved beneficial, mitigating the negative effects of salinity, boosting germination, growth, and physio-biochemical attributes, and suppressing oxidative damage. The study concludes that these conditioning approaches are useful for improving cauliflower germination, survival, and resilience in agroecosystems affected by salinity.",6

The results indicated that dry fronds exhibit significantly greater thermotolerance, close to 55°C, while hydrated fronds withstand temperatures at least 10°C lower. It was concluded that, although the oxidative and antioxidant systems are sensitive to heat in both states, dehydration confers greater thermal resistance to the plant.",7
Transcription profile of auxin related genes during positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature of Brassica rapa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9105288/,transcription profile auxin related genes during,"This study investigated the role of auxin in the gravitropy of young *Brassica rapa* hypocotyls, which initially display positive (downward) curvature followed by the typical negative (upward) curvature. The researchers examined the transcription of the genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 in the curved tissue using tissue extraction and a high-resolution solid-phase gene extraction (SPGE) technique. They found that, during the initial phase of downward curvature, transcription of these genes was activated in the lower flank and deactivated in the upper flank. After 48 hours, when the hypocotyls were upright and exhibited negative gravitropy, this transcription profile reversed. The transcription profiles were spatially distinct within the tissue and comparable to those of root tips, suggesting similar physiological processes. The results indicate that temporal and spatial changes in the transcription of these auxin-regulated genes control both positive and negative hypocotyl gravitropy.",7
High-gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism: Results from a space experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9617909/,high gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism,"An experiment conducted on the International Space Station with Brassica rapa investigated how plants grow in weightlessness and the effect of high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMFs) on their orientation. The study confirmed that HGMFs can induce curvature in roots, allowing plants to orient themselves in space. Plants sense weightlessness, adjusting their metabolism with an increase in amyloplast size and changes in amylase transcription, which contrasts with the effects of mechanostimulation. These findings suggest that clinorotation is not an accurate substitute for simulating microgravity in space research.",8
Lipid rafts and plant gravisensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695138/,lipid rafts and plant gravisensitivity,"This text explores plant cell membranes and membrane microdomains, known as lipid rafts, whose investigation is crucial for optimizing plant growth in Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) on space missions. These rafts are variable, stabilized microdomains within the membrane, characterized by a specific composition of lipids (such as sterols and sphingolipids) and proteins. They are involved in numerous vital processes, including signaling, transport, sensing of gravity and other stressors (such as drought or cold), cell division, adaptation to stress, and regulation of cell death. Microgravity and mechanical stress (simulated by clinorotation) alter their composition, for example, by increasing the saturated fatty acid content, suggesting increased stiffness and reduced membrane permeability. These rafts have been identified in various plant species, and their functioning is intrinsically linked to the organization of the cytoskeleton and the ability of plants to respond and adapt to changing environmental conditions.",6
Expression and characterization of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS in Xenopus laevis oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3503204/,expression and characterization of bacterial mechanosensitive channel,"This study investigates the function of MscS-Like (MSL) proteins in *Arabidopsis thaliana* as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels in plants. Researchers demonstrated that the MSL10 protein, when heterologously expressed in *Xenopus laevis* oocytes, exhibits MS channel activity. This channel has a conductance of approximately 100 pS, shows a moderate preference for anions (approximately six chloride ions for every one sodium ion), is modulated by positive and negative membrane potentials, and is reversibly inhibited by gadolinium. Furthermore, it exhibits asymmetric activation and inactivation kinetics, closing at voltages significantly lower than those required for its opening. This electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of the structure and function of this important protein family in plants.",7
United in Diversity: Mechanosensitive Ion Channels in Plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896955/,"united, diversity, mechanosensitive, ion, channels, plants","This study identifies the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor 3 (S1PR3) as critical regulators of acute mechanical nociception. Genetic or pharmacological deletion of S1PR3, or blocking S1P production, significantly decreases the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, without affecting innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by rapidly conducting A-type mechanonociceptors, whose excitability is modulated by S1PR3 signaling through KCNQ2/3 channels. The findings establish that constitutive S1P/S1PR3 signaling is essential for establishing normal mechanical pain thresholds, as opposed to elevated S1P levels that only cause thermal hypersensitivity.",6
Expressing and Characterizing Mechanosensitive Channels in Xenopus Oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469364/,expressing and characterizing mechanosensitive channels xenopus,"This text describes detailed methods for the heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) in *Xenopus laevis* oocytes. This system is widely used due to its simplicity, reliability, low background ion channel activity, large size, low cost, and ease of handling, allowing the study of channels such as *Escherichia coli* MscS and *Arabidopsis thaliana* MSL10 after inactivating endogenous MSCs in the oocyte. Key methodological steps include frog surgery, oocyte isolation and preparation, in vitro RNA production and injection, and electrophysiological characterization using patch-clamp and pressure-clamp techniques. The importance of water quality and proper storage of solutions is emphasized at all stages of the procedure.",6
The ongoing search for the molecular basis of plant osmosensing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411250/,ongoing search for molecular basis plant,"This text addresses the response of terrestrial plants to osmotic challenges, highlighting their dependence on water status for growth and development, and the importance of understanding these mechanisms to mitigate the effects of drought. Plants balance photosynthesis with water loss through stomata and maintain cell turgor, which is crucial for their structure and function. Water status is measured by water potential, and it is important to differentiate between low water availability and hyperosmotic stress, which elicit distinct cellular responses. Plants also experience hypoosmotic stress due to rewetting or pathogens. Three models for osmosensing are proposed: direct perception of osmotic imbalance in the membrane (possibly through histidine kinases or calcium channels such as OSCA1), mechanosensitive channels that respond to membrane tension (such as MCA channels), and mechanisms that monitor cell wall integrity. The interface between the plasma membrane and the cell wall is a critical point for detecting these stimuli.",6
Plastid osmotic stress influences cell differentiation at the plant shoot apex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047659/,"plastid, osmotic, stress, influences, cell, differentiation","This study examines how plastid osmotic stress affects cell differentiation in the shoot apical meristem of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. *msl2 msl3* mutants, which exhibit constitutive osmotic stress in plastids, were found to develop a callus at the shoot apex with markedly enlarged and deformed plastids. This callus production requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is associated with elevated cytokinin levels, downregulation of the cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the WUSCHEL gene. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced callus requires elevated plastid reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, and the retrograde signaling proteins GUN1 and ABI4. These results support a model where the cytokinin/WUSCHEL pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex in response to plastid stress.",6
Spaceflight-induced synaptic modifications within hair cells of the mammalian utricle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5454470/,spaceflight induced synaptic modifications within hair cells,"A study investigated synaptic modifications in the inner ear utricle of mice exposed to 15 days of microgravity on a space shuttle, comparing them with ground-based controls. Immunohistochemistry detected a decrease in synaptic density in the medial extrastriola of the utricle, a region linked to the encoding of static head position. These findings demonstrate localized structural plasticity of utricular hair cells to adapt to novel gravitational environments, consistent with previous reports of decreased utricular function in astronauts.",8
Effects of angular frequency during clinorotation on mesenchymal stem cell morphology and migration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515506/,angular frequency during clinorotation mesenchymal stem,"This study investigated the short-term effects of simulated microgravity, using different clinorotation speeds (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm), on the behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using a novel lab-on-a-chip clinostat. The research addressed inconsistencies in previous studies by evaluating how clinorotation speed affected hMSC morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration over 8 hours. The results showed that hMSCs responded by adopting more rounded and less spread morphologies, with higher angular frequencies inhibiting cell spreading more. Although the cells remained viable and were able to re-extend, clinorotation compromised their motility, causing retraction rather than migration. The angular frequency dependence suggests that the cells sense the rate of gravitational perturbation, which has implications for stem cell regulation, therapeutic applications, and understanding human health in microgravity.",10

FGF-2 was found to stimulate osteoblast proliferation and the expression of growth- and angiogenesis-associated genes, while reducing the expression of mineralization-related genes. In contrast, BMP-2 significantly induces the expression of mineralization genes, with little or no effect on growth-associated genes. This suggests that FGF-2 is crucial for initial osteoblast growth in early fracture repair, and BMP-2 is critical for stimulating mineralization.",8
"Nutritional supplements, COX-2 and IGF-1 expression in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002170/,nutritional supplements cox 2 and igf 1 expression,"three-month, randomized, double-blind clinical study investigated the effects of lycopene (30 mg/day) and fish oil (3 g/day) supplements versus placebo on gene expression of the normal prostate microenvironment in 69 men with low-risk prostate cancer under active surveillance. Although lycopene and fish oil were hypothesized to reduce IGF-1 and COX-2 gene expression, respectively, the results showed no significant changes in IGF-1 expression in the lycopene group or COX-2 expression in the fish oil group compared with placebo. This suggests that a three-month intervention with these supplements does not significantly alter the expression of IGF-1 and COX-2 in the normal prostatic microenvironment in these patients.",8
To Infinity and Beyond! Human space flight and life science.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6188462/,infinity and beyond human spaceflight life,"Space exploration, inspired by the science fiction of authors such as Verne and Wells, became a reality through technological advances. Early flights, including experiments with animals like the dog Laika, and the human missions Apollo and Skylab, revealed the profound effects of microgravity on the body. Among the most significant physiological changes are fluid displacement, causing ""puffy face and bird's feet"" syndrome, and ""space anemia"" due to reduced plasma volume and erythropoietin. Progressive space osteoporosis has also been documented, with bone and calcium loss continuing even with exercise, suggesting an underlying cellular mechanism. In addition, immunosuppression was observed, affecting lymphocyte and T cell activation. These findings underscore the significant challenges to human health during long-duration spaceflight.",8
Hyperoxia inhibits T cell activation in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11470607/,Hyperoxia inhibits cell activation mice,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in premature infants, where type II epithelial cell (AEC II) dysfunction is key. This study investigated the role of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and their mechanisms in BPD. Using public data, clinical samples, a mouse model of hyperoxia-induced BPD, and a co-culture system, it was found that BPD patients and mice exposed to hyperoxia exhibited increased iNKT cell activation. Inhibition of iNKT cells alleviated abnormal lung development in mice, while their activation or transfer aggravated it. In a coculture system, the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia exacerbated the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1? in AEC II and promoted ferroptosis of these cells. The findings suggest that the recruitment and overactivation of iNKT cells in the lung are an important cause of alveolarization disturbance in BPD, by inducing ferroptosis in AEC II.",6
"Effects of gravitational mechanical unloading in endothelial cells: association between caveolins, inflammation and adhesion molecules",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603133/,gravitational mechanical unloading endothelial cells association,"study investigated the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading (MU) on endothelial cell (EC) function and gene expression. MU in human endothelial cells was found to significantly decrease the expression of adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, while increasing the expression of eNOS, caveolin-1, and -2. The cells also showed a reduction in size and cytoskeletal disorganization, with caveolin-1 localizing perinuclearly. Reintroduction of brief periods of mechanical loading (ML) during MU was sufficient to completely reverse these changes. Although MU increased nitrite production, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition did not mitigate the decrease in adhesion and inflammatory molecules. These findings highlight that gravitational forces dramatically affect EC function, with implications for cardiovascular disease and the effects of low-gravity environments.",7
n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation in peripheral artery disease: the OMEGA-PAD trial,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462350/,"n 3, polyunsaturated, fatty acids, supplementation, peripheral","The OMEGA-PAD II trial investigated the effects of three months of high-dose oral supplementation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) in 24 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and claudication. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study found that patients receiving fish oil showed significant increases in their omega-3 index and plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), including lipoxin A5 and resolvin E3, compared with the placebo group. However, no significant changes were observed in markers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), endothelial function, or walking ability. The study concludes that fish oil increases MPS in patients with PAD, but further research is needed to determine whether these changes translate into clinical improvements.",8
Molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced functions of three-dimensional hepatocyte aggregates,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012541/,"molecular, mechanisms, underlying, enhanced, functions, three dimensional","Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes in rotating wall (RWV) bioreactors significantly improves their synthetic and metabolic functions compared to monolayer culture (TCD). A global analysis of gene expression revealed that the upregulated genes in 3D culture are hepatocyte-specific, with a notable overrepresentation of Hnf4a binding sites in their promoters and an increase in the expression of Hnf4a and its target genes. Simultaneously, suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes was observed. These findings demonstrate that 3D cell-cell interactions are crucial for maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of liver function, providing a basis for designing biomaterials that optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications such as drug screening and tissue engineering.",7
Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653058/,spaceflight alters expression microrna during t cell,"This study investigated the effects of spaceflight microgravity on immune function, specifically on T cell activation and microRNA (miRNA) expression, which represents a barrier to long-term space exploration. Using human leukocytes stimulated on the International Space Station with onboard normal gravity controls, miR-21 was found to be significantly upregulated in normal gravity during early T cell activation, but its expression was suppressed in microgravity. This finding, the first to report that spaceflight alters miRNA expression, was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. A global microarray analysis revealed the suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions. The data suggest that gravity regulates T cell activation not only by promoting transcription but also by blocking translation through noncoding RNA mechanisms, and imply that T cell activation may be a self-limiting process mediated by miR-21.",7

Using a mouse adoptive T cell transfer model, researchers induced an antigen-specific immune response in space. In-flight mice that received the antigen (ovalbumin) showed a significant (twofold) increase in specific T cells and a dramatic increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-? (5-fold) and IL-17 (10-fold) compared to ground-based control mice. These results suggest that spaceflight alters the induction of immune tolerance, which could lead to excessive inflammatory responses, a finding with important implications for the health of space travelers.",8

Ingber on cellular tensegrity architecture. Initially a cell biologist, Ingber incorporated engineering to test his theory that cells employ tensegrity (tensional integrity) to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical cues, which is crucial for cell function and tissue development. His work confirmed the fundamental role of physical forces in controlling cellular development and mechanotransduction, highlighting the central role of integrins and the cytoskeleton. This fundamental research has generated technological innovations such as micromagnetic actuators, microfluidic systems for sepsis therapy, and DNA-based nanobiotechnology for constructing artificial tensegrities with applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Crewmember microbiome may influence microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190111/,"crewmember, microbiome, may, influence, microbial, composition","The Microbial Tracking-2 study investigated the microbial interaction between the International Space Station (ISS) and a crew member using metagenomic sequencing. Body samples (mouth, nose, ear, skin, saliva) from the crew member were analyzed at different stages pre-, during, and post-flight, as well as from eight environmental surfaces on the ISS. The results revealed that the microbial composition of the crew member's skin, nose, and ear was more similar to that of ISS surfaces than that of the mouth and saliva. Furthermore, the species diversity in saliva decreased during flight and recovered upon return to Earth. This pioneering study concludes that the microbiome on ISS surfaces resembles that of crew skin, which is crucial for microbial surveillance and the design of preventive measures on future long-duration space missions.",8

Bioaerosol samples were collected at four different altitudes (from 10,000 to 40,000 feet) and analyzed using metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional cultivation methods. Results showed that microbial composition and diversity changed significantly with altitude and between sampling days, identifying distinct predominant genera at each altitude and detecting viable bacteria in the upper troposphere. The project also developed a model to estimate the probability of human exposure to bioaerosols, seeking to lay the groundwork for global monitoring of bioaerosol emissions and impacts.",7

The study characterized microbial communities, their temporal and spatial shifts, the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes, functional capabilities, and microbial interactions. The ISS microbiome was found to be dominated by bacteria (82%) and fungi (10%), primarily organisms associated with human skin such as Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. Significant temporal changes in the microbial population were observed, but not spatial differences, and antimicrobial resistance gene profiles remained stable over time, with resistance to macrolides/lincosamides/streptogramins being the most widespread. The data revealed a propensity for amino acid utilization and strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera.

Detection of Target Genes for Drug Repurposing to Treat Skeletal Muscle Atrophy in Mice Flown in Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953707/,"detection, target, genes, for, drug, repurposing","The article investigates skeletal muscle atrophy, common in aging, diabetes, and microgravity spaceflight, with the goal of identifying existing drugs for therapeutic repurposing. To do so, it uses link prediction algorithms in gene-disease and disease-drug networks constructed from transcriptomic data from mice exposed to spaceflight (GeneLab). Using network analysis and machine learning, such as graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), key genes regulating muscle atrophy, primarily associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, were identified. The GCN method proved to be the most effective for link prediction.

Initial results confirmed previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation during spaceflight, observing a significant increase in mitochondrial DNA and cfRNA. A fraction enriched in mitochondrial DNA associated with the CD36 receptor was identified, suggesting that mitochondrial components from various tissues are released into the plasma. Comparison with data from mice exposed to artificial gravity established a link between microgravity and these mitochondrial responses. Furthermore, changes were detected in cfRNAs related to reactive oxygen species, the nervous system, skeletal muscle, and the vitamin D receptor signaling pathway, indicating systemic alterations. This minimally invasive approach is key to detailed longitudinal monitoring and the development of countermeasures for future long-duration space missions.",8
Increasing the number of unloading/reambulation cycles does not adversely impac body composition and lumbar bone mineral density but reduces tissue sensitivity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747666/,"increasing, number, unloading, reambulation, cycles, does","This study investigated the effects of repeated cycles of hindlimb unloading (HLU) and reambulation (RA) in mice, comparing one, two, or three exposures with controls. All HLU groups showed losses in body mass, abdominal adipose tissue (primarily visceral), and vertebral bone mineral density. However, the first cycle of HLU resulted in significantly greater initial losses of body mass and total adipose tissue compared with subsequent cycles, indicating an attenuation of the response. Both abdominal adipose tissue and vertebral bone mineral density recovered to levels similar to those of controls after the final period of RA, regardless of the number of cycles. In contrast, hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area remained significantly smaller than in controls even after reambulation. The results suggest that abdominal tissues are more resilient to multiple episodes of unloading and more prone to recovery than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.",9
Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337661/,"bone, shaft, bending, strength, index, unaffected","Anthropologists often use the femoral flexural strength index (Imax/Imin) to infer the physical activity levels of past humans from skeletal remains, assuming that high values indicate greater activity and low values indicate sedentary behavior. However, a study in mice tested this assumption using treadmill exercise experiments to simulate high activity and limb suspension exercises to simulate low activity. The results showed that while activity altered bone robustness (Imax and Imin), there was no significant change in the Imax/Imin ratio in either group. This suggests that caution should be exercised when using this index to reconstruct past activity levels in humans.",8
Focal enhancement of the skeleton to exercise correlates to mesenchymal stem cell responsivity rather than peak external forces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631774/,"focal enhancement, skeleton, exercise, correlates, mesenchymal","This study in mice investigated bone adaptation to exercise and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsiveness. Although the forelimbs generated significantly greater peak forces than the hindlimbs during locomotion, the effects of exercise on the skeleton were site-specific and not defined by the magnitude of the load. The bone structures of the femur, tibia, and ulna showed significant improvements after exercise, whereas the humerus and radius, which experienced greater forces, did not. Bone marrow-derived MSCs in the femur were more sensitive to exercise-induced loads than those in the humerus, with their population decreasing. This suggests that the ability of progenitor populations to differentiate toward osteogenesis may better correlate with bone structural adaptation than maximum external forces.",10
"Cytoskeletal configuration modulates mechanically induced changes in mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis, morphology, and stiffness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052530/,cytoskeletal configuration modulates mechanically induced changes,"This study investigated the response of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to low-intensity vibrations (LIV) applied horizontally or vertically in 2D culture. All LIV signals were found to enhance hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and the expression of genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. However, the cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs. 30 Hz) and when LIV was applied horizontally, realigning the cytoskeleton and increasing cell stiffness. The results suggest that applying small oscillatory movements within the plane of cell adhesion is more effective than perpendicularly, facilitating a more efficient transfer of intracellular forces and emphasizing the importance of cytoskeletal configuration in the detection of high-frequency, low-intensity mechanical signals.",10
Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114340/,"genetic, and, tissue, level, muscle bone, interactions","study involving 352 genetically heterogeneous mice investigated the interaction between muscle and bone during three weeks of hindlimb unloading, followed by three weeks of reambulation. The objective was to determine whether muscle changes are associated with bone changes and whether their genetic regulation overlaps. The results showed that while most mice lost muscle and cortical bone during unloading and regained them at different rates during reambulation, morphological changes between muscle and bone (cortical and trabecular) were not correlated. Furthermore, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified for muscle area and cortical bone during unloading and reambulation showed largely distinct genetic regulation. These low correlations and genetic divergence suggest that the hypothesis of a ""muscle-bone unit"" that co-adjusts its size in response to mechanical loading may need to be re-evaluated.",9
Osteocyte apoptosis caused by hindlimb unloading is required to trigger osteocyte RANKL production and subsequent resorption of cortical and trabecular bone in mice femurs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488280/,osteocyte apoptosis caused hindlimb unloading required,"This study investigated the role of osteocyte apoptosis in bone remodeling and loss caused by disuse. Contrary to previous debate, the researchers demonstrated that hindlimb unloading (HLU) in mice significantly increases osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL expression in cortical and trabecular bone, events that precede bone resorption. Pharmacological inhibition of this apoptosis with QVD not only prevented HLU-induced increases but also halted RANKL production, bone resorption activation, and subsequent trabecular bone loss. This establishes that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in the initiation of disuse bone resorption and loss.",8
Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293686/,"differential, single, cell, responses, embryonic, stem","This study investigated how a 60-minute hypergravity (HG) pulse affects the transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryoid bodies (EBs) using single-cell RNA sequencing. It was found that, although overall transcriptomic changes were limited, HG induced greater positional changes in EBs compared to ESCs, suggesting that mechanotransduction is more pronounced at advanced stages of cellular commitment. Specifically, HG resulted in the upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, it was associated with the activation of multicellular developmental pathways, mechanistic signal transduction, and DNA damage repair, promoting the maintenance of transient cellular phenotypes. The study concludes that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravitational mechanostimulation, and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced transcriptomic changes.",9

The findings reveal a novel role for macrophages, which form clusters around spores and inhibit their germination, promoting fungal persistence. Direct spore germination was found to boost their clearance, with faster-growing strains (such as CEA10) being better killed by neutrophils than slower-growing strains (such as Af293). Furthermore, host inflammatory activation is crucial for the elimination of the CEA10 strain, but insufficient for Af293, underscoring the intrinsic differences in fungal virulence. The study highlights the diverse modes of virulence of *A. fumigatus* and offers valuable information for future strategies in the treatment of fungal infections in immunocompromised individuals.",7
Contributions of spore secondary metabolites to UV-C protection and virulence vary in different Aspergillus fumigatus strains,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029147/,"contributions, spore, secondary, metabolites, uv c, protection","study investigated the role of secondary metabolites, especially melanin, in spores of the pathogenic fungus *Aspergillus fumigatus* against UV-C radiation and their virulence. Melanin was found to protect spores from UV-C radiation in some clinical strains of *A. fumigatus*, but not in a strain isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). Furthermore, fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C protective properties, whereas other metabolites such as monomethylsulocrine and fumigaclavine did not.

Light and gravity signals synergize in modulating plant development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211383/,Light and gravity signals synergize modulating,"Plants perform directed growth movements, known as tropisms, to adapt to environmental stimuli such as gravity (gravitropism) and light (phototropism), phenomena that have been shown to be interconnected. Current research, including experiments in microgravity, seeks to decouple these processes to better understand their molecular mechanisms. Microgravity has been observed to alter meristematic cells, affecting cell proliferation, the cell cycle, and ribosome biogenesis. Light, especially red light mediated by phytochromes, and phytohormones such as auxin, significantly influence these responses. Charles Darwin pioneered the study of these movements, postulating the existence of a factor that mediated the growth response. Gravity perception is localized to specialized cells (statocytes) and is primarily explained by the starch-statolith hypothesis, where dense amyloplasts sediment, guiding the distribution of auxin for directed growth (roots downward, stems upward). An alternative hypothesis, the protoplast pressure hypothesis, suggests that the cytoplasmic mass exerts tension. Future experiments on the International Space Station will continue to elucidate these complex mechanisms and their implications for plant development.",6

Changes in gene expression related to hypoxia, heat shock, DNA repair, and cell wall structure were detected in the spaceflight samples, supported by glycomic profiling that showed differences in cell wall components. Comparison with two other BRIC-16 experiments performed simultaneously with the same hardware revealed that, despite similarities, differences in gene expression results were found due to variations in genotypes, tissues, and analytical techniques. However, a common theme among the three studies was the deregulation of water stress-responsive genes and cell wall remodeling.

Analogous ground-based methods are also described, such as clinostats, random positioning machines (RPMs), and magnetic levitation, which attempt to simulate altered gravity by rotating specimens to constantly change the direction of the gravitational vector. However, it is noteworthy that these analogs do not reduce gravity but only change its direction, introducing artifacts such as centrifugal forces, mechanical stress, and sedimentation, which limits the fidelity of their results compared to real-world space experiments, especially in long-term studies of plant growth.

In aged mice with overexpression of the MnSOD gene, elevated levels of MnSOD were found in the left ventricle, along with lower oxidative stress, mitigation of age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, and a reduction in pro-apoptotic markers and apoptosis.

Researchers used Fischer-344 rats to compare the effects of aging, calorie restriction, and exercise on the plantaris muscle. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins, decreased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) content, increased key membrane repair proteins, and reduced NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits. However, lifelong caloric restriction and exercise significantly protected against these age-related DGC disruptions, maintaining membrane repair proteins and Nox2 subunits near the levels of young animals. The results suggest that caloric restriction and exercise are effective countermeasures against aging-associated myofiber membrane alterations.",8

In rats subjected to hindlimb unloading, mitochondrial function in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was compared between control, unloaded, and SRT2104-unloaded groups. The results showed that SRT2104 preserved mitochondrial function in the unloaded gastrocnemius muscle, as evidenced by reduced proton leak and attenuation of the decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity observed in the untreated group. Although hydrogen peroxide production and concentration were higher in the SRT2104-treated group in both muscles, accompanied by increased superoxide dismutase activity in the gastrocnemius, the study concludes that SRT2104 has the potential to maintain muscle cell health in microgravity by promoting necessary mitochondrial energy production.",8

This study addresses the challenge of modeling this with a bioreactor, testing a StrexCell® system that uses uniaxial cyclic stretch to induce hypertrophy and its cessation to induce atrophy in murine myotubes (C2C12). The results showed that cyclic stretch significantly increased myotube diameter and elevated anabolic markers such as talin and Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, stopping the stretching process caused a decrease in myotube diameter and an increase in inflammatory and catabolic markers, consistent with atrophy. This demonstrates the feasibility of this bioreactor for research into the effect of tensile loading on muscles in spaceflight contexts.",7

The results show that a reduction in the carbon flux towards phenylalanine biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP. This leads to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, a transient accumulation of starch, and lower rates of photosynthetic electron transport, due to an increase in the proton-motive force that dysregulates photosystem II activity. Furthermore, significant changes in secondary metabolites were observed, including a reduction in flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, lignans, and glucosinolates, and an increase in galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Although the most extreme mutant (*adt3/4/5/6*) showed a slight decrease in growth at an intermediate stage, there were no significant differences in respiration and carbon fixation rates.

Effects of spaceflight on the brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,"spaceflight, brain","The study investigated how gravity affects human position sense, employing three methods (two-arm pairing, one-arm pointing, and one-arm repositioning) in 12 participants during parabolic flights, simulating hypergravity (1.8G) and microgravity (0G). The results showed that in hypergravity, errors in the pairing and pointing tasks increased significantly. In microgravity, matching errors decreased markedly, while pointing errors decreased nonsignificantly. The repositioning task did not show significant changes in any of the gravitational conditions. It is suggested that errors in pairing and signaling are a consequence of the action of gravity on the elbow joint, altering the signal to muscle and joint receptors, while repositioning relies on a central memory independent of changes in gravity.",7

Gravity signaling in flowering plant roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12008199/,"gravity, signaling, flowering, plant, roots","This study identifies a rice mutant (*crw1*) that exhibits root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. It is caused by a loss of function of the gene *COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1)*, which encodes an OsEBF1 protein, which amplifies ethylene signaling. This signaling increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the root tip, affecting root tip stability, OsPIN2 polar localization, and auxin distribution, ultimately impairing gravitropism. However, mechanosensation induced by growth in soil or mechanical resistance generates calcium signaling that antagonizes the ethylene pathway, safeguarding gravitropism. The work reveals an unexpected interaction between ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensation in the control of plant gravitropism.",6

A genetic screen identified the *cadaverine hypersensitive 3* (cdh3) mutation, which confers cadaverine hypersensitivity and affects the BIO3-BIO1 gene, which is key in biotin production. The research demonstrated that cadaverine directly reduces BIO3-BIO1 activity and the biotinylation of essential proteins for fatty acid synthesis, such as BCCP1, thereby affecting lipid metabolism and root growth. Supplementation with biotin or its intermediates reversed this sensitivity, confirming the role of cadaverine as a regulator of the biotin pathway.",7

The findings revealed that all types of radiation induced transcription of lytic genes and significantly increased viral load compared to controls. Although gamma rays were more effective in initial reactivation, high-energy particles (protons, carbon, iron) caused a more sustained and delayed reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription, challenging the concept of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for this type of response. This suggests that radiation can directly reactivate latent viruses, independent of changes in the immune system.",7

This sustained activation of NF-? in MuSCs during chronic injury leads to telomere shortening, Ku80 dysregulation, increased DNA damage (specifically at telomeres), MuSC loss, and severe defects in skeletal muscle, culminating in regenerative failure. Importantly, this mechanism acts independently of cell replication. These findings propose a crucial and previously unknown role for NF-? in regulating stem cell-specific telomere length and contributing to MuSC dysfunction and DMD progression, which could have implications for other diseases characterized by chronic systemic inflammation.",10
Piezo1 regulates the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles via orchestration of stem cell morphological states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932657/,"Piezo1 regulates regenerative capacity, skeletal muscles","The authors investigated the contribution of muscle stem cell (MuSC) morphology to their in vivo function. They found that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous, exhibiting different patterns of cellular processes, and classified them into three distinct functional states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. They demonstrated that the protein Piezo1 regulates the transition between these states, promoting regeneration. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 renders MuSCs more responsive, whereas its deletion mimics the dysfunction observed in dystrophic muscles. Reactivation of Piezo1 ameliorated the morphological and regenerative defects of MuSCs in these muscles. These findings reveal how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator of stem cell states essential for regeneration.",10
"Impacts of radiation exposure, hindlimb unloading, and recovery on murine skeletal muscle cell telomere length.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10504369/,"impacts, radiation, exposure, hindlimb, unloading, and","This study investigated telomere changes in muscle cells from mice subjected to a terrestrial model simulating spaceflight conditions, combining radiation exposure and hindlimb unloading. The results showed significant telomere lengthening in muscle stem cells and myofiber nuclei, but not in resident endothelial cells, under the combination of radiation and unloading. Furthermore, this lengthening did not return to baseline values after a recovery period. These findings suggest that telomeres play a role in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant to astronauts' well-being in space and upon their return to Earth.",7
Ethylene-induced flavonol accumulation in guard cells suppresses reactive oxygen species and modulates stomatal aperture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982735/,"ethylene induced, flavonol, accumulation, guard, cells, suppresses","This study demonstrates that flavonols accumulate specifically in the guard cells of *Arabidopsis* leaves, where they act as antioxidants and reduce levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are crucial for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. The presence of flavonols slows the rate of ABA-mediated stomatal closure; mutant plants lacking flavonols display faster stomatal closure. Furthermore, ethylene upregulates flavonol accumulation in guard cells, with increased ethylene resulting in higher flavonol levels, lower ROS, and slower stomatal closure. These results suggest that flavonols suppress ROS accumulation and decrease the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases in flavonols in guard cells modulating these responses.",7
Transcriptional and Hormonal Regulation of Gravitropism of Woody Stems in Populus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682325/,"transcriptional and hormonal regulation, gravitropism, woody","This study investigates the fundamental mechanisms of gravitropism in woody stems of Populus, where angiosperm trees reorient themselves by producing tension tissue at the top of the stem. Initial gravity perception involves amyloplast sedimentation and relocalization of the auxin transporter PIN3. Gibberellin (GA) stimulates tension wood formation and gravitational bending, while the transcription factor ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2) influences contractile fiber maturation and the response to GA. The researchers generated transcriptomes to model the transcriptional networks of wood formation, identifying that ARK2 expression modulates the gravitational bending capacity and maturation rate of wood tensile fibers, specifically G-layers, which are crucial for generating strength. They observed that overexpression of ARK2 accelerates G-layer maturation and enhances bending, while its decrease delays it and reduces bending, even if more fibers are produced, suggesting that fiber functionality and maturation speed are more important than their quantity. A model is proposed in which auxin transport to the cambium at the top of the stem, influenced by the location of PIN3-expressing cells, triggers tension wood formation.",8
Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10264680/,"endosidin2, targets, conserved, exocyst, complex, subunit","This study investigated the role of the exocyst complex in protein delivery to the plant plasma membrane. Using the inhibitor Endosidin2 (ES2) in Arabidopsis seedling roots and quantitative proteomic analysis, we found that ES2 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins. These proteins, which serve diverse roles in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, and stress response, are likely exocyst-mediated cargoes, indicating that the exocyst complex mediates the constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.",6
"conditional mutation in SCD1 reveals linkage between PIN protein trafficking, auxin transport, gravitropism, and lateral root initiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358545/,conditional mutation scd1 reveals linkage between,"This study used a temperature-sensitive mutation (*scd1-1*) in *Arabidopsis thaliana* to investigate the role of SCD1 in auxin transport and plant development. Polar auxin transport, essential for root growth, lateral root formation, and gravitropism, depends on the correct localization of PIN proteins. Unlike non-conditional mutants with complex phenotypes, *scd1-1* showed that, at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, the mutant exhibited reduced auxin transport, lateral root development, and gravitropic responses. Crucially, PIN2 protein accumulation in endomembranes occurred within just 20 minutes of the shift to 25°C, while developmental defects and gravitropism only became apparent hours later. This demonstrates that altered PIN2 trafficking precedes and causes subsequent defects in auxin transport and related developmental processes, with these effects being reversible upon return to the permissive temperature.",7

Using a 3D clinostat and mammary epithelial cells (with either the intact or disrupted LINC complex), the researchers demonstrated that both nuclear shape and differential gene expression are sensitive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner, and that these responses vary with the duration of exposure. Cells with the dysfunctional LINC complex showed significant alterations in nuclear morphology compared to control cells, and differential modulation in the regulation of a greater number of genes. These results suggest that the LINC complex is a crucial mediator of cellular responses to altered gravity environments.",8

Six bacterial strains were isolated from permafrost that demonstrated growth under these extreme conditions. All were identified as species of the genus *Carnobacterium*, related to other *Carnobacterium* species found in polar environments. Tests confirmed that both the isolated strains and nine other type species of *Carnobacterium* can thrive in cold, low-pressure, and anoxious environments, even showing enhanced growth in some, extending the known limits of low-pressure life and highlighting their importance for astrobiology and planetary protection.",8

DNA repair mechanisms (NHEJ and AP endonucleases), SASP proteins (small acid-soluble spore proteins), dipicolinic acid (DPA), and low nuclear water content were found to be critical for their protection. DNA repair was found to be the most important defense mechanism. The ?/?-type SASPs also offered synergistic radioprotective effects by binding to DNA, unlike the ?-type SASPs. In contrast, oxygen radical detoxification played a very minor role in the resistance of dormant spores, which showed the greatest sensitivity to high-energy charged iron ions.",7
Cultivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the human spaceflight environment leads to alterations in the frequency and spectrum of spontaneous rifampicin-resistance mutations in the rpoB gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923109/,"cultivation, staphylococcus epidermidis, human, spaceflight, environment","study investigated the effect of the spaceflight environment on the growth and frequency of antibiotic resistance mutations in *Staphylococcus epidermidis*. Cultures of the bacteria were grown for 122 hours on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-based controls. The results showed that, although there were significantly fewer viable cells in space, the frequency of rifampicin resistance mutations was significantly higher, and the spectrum of mutations in the *rpoB* gene was altered. This suggests that the space environment induces physiological stress that alters the bacterial mutagenic potential. This phenomenon is crucial for future long-duration space missions, as the stress of spaceflight can compromise astronauts' immune systems and alter the pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant potential of microorganisms, such as the ubiquitous *S. epidermidis*, increasing the risk of resistant infections.",10
Experimental Evolution of Bacillus subtilis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11673879/,"experimental, evolution, bacillus subtilis","This study investigated the thermal adaptation capacity of Bacillus bacteria, essential to ecosystems, in the face of gradually rising global temperatures. Seven strains from the B. cereus and B. subtilis lineages were exposed to increasingly warming conditions in experimental evolution. The results showed that, despite some minor improvements, none of the strains managed to significantly adapt to grow at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range, and only one B. subtilis line extended its thermal niche by four degrees. Convergent mutations in genes regulating the synthesis of c-di-AMP, a molecule related to potassium transport, were found to play a crucial and previously unknown role in heat tolerance. The findings caution about the limited ability of these bacteria to develop substantial thermal tolerance, even under gradual selection, raising concerns about the resilience of bacterial communities and the potential impacts on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability in the face of climate change.",6

Environmental dependence of competitive fitness in rifampin-resistant rpoB mutants of Bacillus subtilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8904044/,"environmental, dependence, competitive, fitness, rifampin resistant, rpob","The text explores how mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB gene, which confer resistance to rifampicin (Rifr), affect the competitive fitness of bacteria, demonstrating that this effect is significantly dependent on the environment. Historically, Rifr was associated with reduced fitness, but this investigation, using deep sequencing and competition assays in rich and minimal media, revealed that the competitive advantage of specific rpoB alleles varies depending on the environment. For example, in rich medium the wild type dominates, whereas in minimal medium a particular Rifr mutant may prevail, and compensatory mutations can even arise that dramatically increase fitness. These findings underscore the importance of environmental context in understanding the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, even in the absence of direct selection by antibiotics.",7

Gene expression analysis revealed metabolic alterations and downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, suggesting a conserved response among prokaryotes. The collective results indicate that *S. aureus* responds to a low fluid shear environment by adopting a colonization/biofilm phenotype with decreased virulence, which could help understand the divergence between infection and colonization.",7

The aim was to understand the role of these plasmids in pathogenicity and, in particular, in bacterial persistence under stress conditions, given that pChi7122-1 had previously been linked to systemic infection. Sequencing revealed that pChi7122-2 encodes an iron ABC transport system (eitABCD), sugar catabolic pathways, and antibiotic resistance genes, while pChi7122-3 encodes type IV fimbriae; pChi7122-4 was found to be a cryptic plasmid. Both pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 were shown to be self-conjugating. In vitro evaluations indicated that the nature and combinations of the plasmids, as well as the genetic background of the host strain, affect phenomena such as biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and interaction with epithelial cells. This work offers new insights into how extrachromosomal sequences contribute to the fitness and phenotypic diversity of ExPECs, although the expression of some iron systems would require specific conditions such as those in vivo.",7

Using the same 3D model and highly purified Norwalk norovirus (NV), results showed no evidence of viral replication, either by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis also revealed the absence of blood group antigens that are crucial for NV binding. To explain the cytopathic effects (CPE) observed in the previous study, the researchers exposed the 3D cultures to lipopolysaccharides, finding morphological changes similar to CPE.

Resistance to oxidative stress, however, was decreased in all tested genera. Contrary to previous hypotheses, targeted mutations in the trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator did not alter the response to MSMM in S. Typhimurium and E. coli.

It is hypothesized that this condition causes physiological adaptations that result in a greater abundance of ACE2 receptors in the lung, an exaggerated pulmonary immune response, increased capillary fluid leakage into the airways, and a decreased ability to clear said fluid. These mechanisms suggest that excessive fluid accumulation in the lungs, characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is exacerbated by chronic dehydration.

Challenges and considerations for single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics sample collection during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9701605/,Challenges and considerations for single cell spatially,"The text highlights the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) on Earth, contrasting with their limited implementation in spaceflight studies. These technologies are crucial for understanding the effects of the space environment on the human body, vital knowledge for future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, given that the genomic impact of microgravity and radiation is poorly understood. Although most space-based ""omics"" experiments have used bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq), scRNA-seq and SRT offer much higher resolution, allowing for the identification of specific cell types and their responses, as well as maintaining spatial information about the tissue. Currently, only a limited number of space-based experiments have applied scRNA-seq (such as RRRM-2 in mice and the NASA Twins Study in humans), and even fewer have applied SRT, facing significant challenges in tissue preservation and sample processing in space. To advance space biology, it is imperative to optimize experimental design protocols, especially in tissue preservation and data analysis, to fully exploit the potential of these high-resolution techniques.",9

Given this, the objective was to develop a protocol for using RNAlater-fixed samples in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A method was developed with *Arabidopsis thaliana* that included desalting, methanol dehydration, liquid ethane immersion, cryosubstitution, critical point drying, and SEM imaging. The resulting protocol allowed for acceptable SEM images of RNAlater-fixed tissues, preserving gross morphology and fine details such as root hairs and trichomes, comparable to fresh-frozen samples.

Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio: A biomarker to monitor the immune status of astronauts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667275/,neutrophil lymphocyte ratio biomarker monitor immune,"NASA seeks to understand immune dysfunction in space and find biomarkers for astronaut health in flight. The study proposes that an elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker, as leukocyte counts are altered during spaceflight. Elevated NLR was observed in rodents and astronauts in space, and similar results were replicated in simulated microgravity models using human leukocytes and mice. Simulated microgravity caused redox imbalance and inflammatory neutrophil activation, effects that were reversed with antioxidants. Additionally, genetically modified mice with lower oxidative stress showed a reduced inflammatory response. In conclusion, spaceflight and simulated microgravity consistently elevate NLR, indicating it as a promising biomarker for monitoring astronaut immune health, with oxidative stress as a key mechanism.",10

Flies were exposed to microgravity (SFÎ¼g) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via centrifugation. Although flies in SFÎ¼g showed increased activity during flight, they exhibited significant postflight climbing defects, with males more affected. Multi-omic analyses revealed metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission alterations in SFÎ¼g and SF1g. However, immediate post-flight neurological changes, such as neuronal loss, glial cell alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, were only observed in SFÎ¼g. After acclimatization to terrestrial conditions, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype were observed in the brains of both SF1g and SFÎ¼g groups, being more pronounced in SFÎ¼g. The results suggest that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.",9

Changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues were found to be predominantly the result of preservation (immediate dissection in orbit versus frozen carcasses upon return to Earth), making data interpretation difficult. This variability is exacerbated by the use of polyA selection in RNA library preparation and affects transcriptional integrity. These findings have crucial implications for the interpretation of existing data sets and the design of future experiments, suggesting ribodepletion as a more suitable alternative to mitigate these biases.",8

The experiments, performed shortly after return to Earth, analyzed negative gravitaxis behavior, statocyte electrophysiological responses, and neuropeptide gene expression. The results showed that post-flight snails exhibited reduced reorientation latency (enhanced negative gravitaxis), increased sensitivity to acceleration in statocyte responses, and a significant increase in statocyte mRNA expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) gene. These findings, which are similar to those observed in vertebrates, suggest an upregulation of statocyst function in response to microgravity, underscoring fundamental and conserved principles in sensing gravity and adapting to its changes.",8

Using an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, the spatial distribution of RBCs was quantified by microscopy and image analysis, and complex flow patterns were analyzed with microparticle image velocimetry (PIV) and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The results revealed that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is heterogeneous and distinct from that of the inflow. Above a threshold shear rate, inertial streamline separation and lift forces contribute to uneven RBC distribution in vortices, their trapping, and nonmonotonic shear stresses on pocket walls. This experimental and computational characterization offers a better understanding of the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and shear rates in venous valve models, which is crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving the efficiency of cell separation.",6

The research demonstrates that HOPS mediates vacuolar fusion in plants by interacting with SNARE proteins, identifying the subunits VPS33 and SYP22 as key sites of interaction. VPS33 and VPS41 were found to localize to late endosomes, while only VPS41 was found to localize to the tonoplast. Unlike other eukaryotes, HOPS recruitment to liposomes in plants is inhibited by phosphoinositides, suggesting a specific regulatory mechanism. VPS41 knockdown leads to significant vacuolar fragmentation, confirming the importance of HOPS in this process.

Exposure to hypergravity significantly reduced the body weight of both dams and pups, and dramatically increased pup mortality (decreasing from 95% to 48% survival between day of delivery and postnatal day 3). Alterations in mammary, hepatic, and adipose tissue metabolism were observed, including decreased glucose oxidation and lipid synthesis in the mammary gland. Plasma levels of prolactin, corticosterone, and insulin were also affected. Hypergravity altered the expression of circadian clock genes in the breast and liver, and impacted maternal behavioral circadian rhythms, affecting activities such as feeding, nest building, and pup care. These findings suggest that gravity-induced alterations in the maternal circadian system may limit the homeorrheal adaptations necessary for successful lactation.",8

We show that BZR1 promotes the division of quiescent center (QC) cells but suppresses the differentiation of columella stem cells (CSCs), in contrast to the stimulatory effect of BES1 on CSCs. BRs and BZR1 signaling alter the distribution of PIN proteins, influencing auxin movement, and BZR1 accumulates in the nucleus to modulate gene expression. These mechanisms lead to ectopic activation of the QC and differential differentiation of CSCs, depending on the concentration of BR and the signaling molecule.",9

Loss-of-function mutants of AtANN1 and its homolog AtANN2 showed increased sensitivity to heat stress, while overexpression of AtANN1 conferred increased resistance. The expression of heat shock proteins and factors, as well as the heat-induced increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, were inhibited or severely impaired in AtANN1 and AtANN2 mutants.

The inhibitors were most effective with copper octanoate and least effective with propiconazole, with *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* being the most sensitive pathogen. It is suggested that these inhibitors act by blocking the efflux transporters that fungi use to detoxify fungicides, offering a new strategy to increase the efficacy of antifungal treatments.",7

Mutants deficient in these annexins showed reduced root growth and cap defects when grown without sugar, effects that were reversed by the addition of sucrose or other sugars. Despite increased photosynthetic expression in the cotyledons, mutant roots accumulated more sugar, but its transport to the tips was impaired, as evidenced by impaired dye transport and increased reactive oxygen species and callose that restrict plasmodesmal passage. These findings demonstrate the importance of ANN1 and ANN2 in the distribution of sugars to root tips and their indirect influence on photosynthesis.",7

The results revealed that, compared with controls, SOD1G93A mice with end-stage ALS had significantly reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass and microarchitecture, including less trabecular mass, thinner trabeculae, and reduced cortical thickness and area. These structural deficiencies translated into reduced functional properties of the skeleton, such as decreased femoral flexural stiffness, lower moment at failure, and reduced fracture toughness. It was concluded that this is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of mice with advanced ALS, implicating multiple mechanisms for the increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in ALS patients and providing a strong rationale for interventions aimed at reducing this risk.",8

Using an enhanced partial weight-bearing (PWB) rat model, researchers assessed muscle function and mass at various levels of simulated gravity for one month. The results demonstrated that both muscle mass and function were significantly impaired in reduced-weight environments as early as 7 days. These muscle alterations correlated with the level of PWB and did not reach a plateau over the study period, underscoring the critical need to implement countermeasures to ensure the safety and success of space exploration.",8

The results showed that trabecular bone density of the proximal tibia decreased progressively and proportionally to the degree of unloading, without reaching a plateau by four weeks, and the trabecular microarchitecture of the distal femur also deteriorated in a dose-dependent manner. These alterations were associated with a decrease in osteoblast numbers and surface mineralization (reduced bone formation). In contrast, cortical bone density and microarchitecture showed little or no change, and the functional properties of the femur shaft showed modest or no reductions. The study concludes that this PWB model in rats causes progressive deterioration of trabecular bone, generally proportional to the degree of unloading, with minimal effects on cortical bone, which is relevant for understanding bone loss in partial loading situations such as space.",8

A new role of NAP1L1 in megakaryocytes and human platelets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737020/,new role nap1l1 megakaryocytes and human,"This study investigated the expression and functionality of the NAP1L1 protein in platelets (PLTs) and megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 was found to be expressed in both cells, at the mRNA and protein levels, and localized to the cytoplasm of MKs and perigranularly in PLTs, suggesting non-nuclear functions. The investigation revealed that NAP1L1 dynamically interacts with PDC-E2, a subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, crucial for cellular respiration. Increased NAP1L1 expression and PDH activity were observed in platelets from septic patients. However, overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs significantly decreased proplatelet formation (thrombopoiesis) and PDH activity in a simulated septic environment. These findings suggest that NAP1L1 plays roles other than nucleosome assembly, acting as a potential chaperone or regulator of the mitochondrial protein PDC-E2, and influencing PDH activity and platelet production.",7
Evaluation of rodent spaceflight in the NASA animal enclosure module for an extended operational period (up to 35 days),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515519/,"evaluation, rodent, spaceflight, nasa, animal, enclosure","This study evaluated the ability of NASA's Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), designed for short-haul flights, to support rodents on missions of up to 35 days on the International Space Station. Researchers tested the hardware with 12 C57BL/6 mice and 5 Sprague-Dawley rats, monitoring their health, growth, intake, and environmental parameters. The AEM was shown to support the mice for 35 days with self-contained food and water, and the rats for the same period with external resupply of diet and water, maintaining their well-being and health parameters comparable to vivarium controls. The study concludes that the AEM is flexible and capable of operating for up to 35 days with minor modifications, making it suitable for longer-term space science research with rodents, although additional studies are needed for durations longer than 35 days.",10
Morphology of Penicillium rubens Biofilms Formed in Space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10144393/,"morphology, penicillium, rubens, biofilms, formed, space","This study examined the impact of microgravity on the formation of *Penicillium rubens* fungal biofilms on seven materials relevant to spacecraft and hospital environments, a critical concern for spaceflight due to potential damage to spacecraft and health risks to astronauts. Spore-inoculated materials were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for development for 10, 15, and 20 days, compared to ground-based controls. Although microgravity did not significantly alter the overall morphology, biomass, or surface coverage of biofilms, it did influence their formation, increasing or decreasing the amount of biofilm in some cases, in a time- and material-dependent manner. The Nanograss material showed a significant reduction in biofilm formation both in microgravity and on Earth, making it a potential solution. These findings are essential for understanding and mitigating fungal contamination on space missions.",7
Explainable machine learning identifies multi-omics signatures of muscle response to spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10719374/,"explainable, machine, learning, identifies, multi omics, signatures","This study uses multi-omic and physiological data from mice exposed to microgravity to identify molecular biomarkers associated with muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Using the symbolic regression algorithm QLattice, data from the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles were analyzed to predict calcium reuptake levels. The results indicate that Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins are the most predictive biomarkers for tibialis anterior muscle resilience in space, with Acyp1 negatively correlated with calcium reuptake. These findings offer potential targets for future interventions aimed at reducing muscle atrophy during spaceflight.",9
Microbial adaptation to spaceflight is correlated with bacteriophage-encoded functions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11096397/,Microbial adaptation spaceflight correlated with bacteriophage encoded,"The article investigates microbial adaptation on the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting the role of latent bacteriophages (prophages) as mediators of such adaptation. An analysis of 245 bacterial genomes isolated from the ISS revealed that phage-associated genes are significantly different between space-borne and ground-based strains. A total of 283 complete prophages were identified, 21% of which are novel, and encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as antimicrobial resistance, virulence, DNA repair, and dormancy. These findings suggest that microbial adaptation in space is linked to bacteriophage-encoded functions, which could have implications for human health during extended space missions.",8
Influence of the spaceflight environment on macrophage lineages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166655/,"influence, spaceflight, environment, macrophage, lineages","This article reviews the impact of space and its unique risk factors, such as radiation and altered gravity, on the immune system, with a focus on macrophages. Macrophages are immune cells crucial for innate and adaptive immunity, homeostasis, defense against infection, and wound healing. Research indicates that spaceflight can alter leukocyte count and function, causing chronic low-grade inflammation. Changes in monocyte count, phagocytic activity, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation/polarization have been observed in both humans and rodents, although with some differences between species. Furthermore, spaceflight affects specialized macrophages such as osteoclasts, contributing to bone loss, and microglia, which could induce neuroinflammation. A thorough understanding of these responses is critical for astronaut health and for developing countermeasures for future missions, although further in-flight research is required to fully characterize their altered phenotypes and functions.",7
MARSBOx: Fungal and bacterial resistance from a balloon-flown analog mission in the stratosphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937622/,Marsbox fungal and bacterial endurance from,"study investigated the ability of terrestrial life to withstand the Martian environment via a NASA science balloon mission to the mid-stratosphere (âˆ¼38 km altitude) in September 2019. This altitude simulates the radiation, dehydration, hypoxia, and low temperature and pressure conditions of the equatorial surface of Mars. Samples of fungal spores (Aspergillus niger) and bacterial cells (Salinisphaera shabanensis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9) were exposed in the MARSBOx module, some to full UV-VIS radiation and others shielded. After five hours, A. niger spores and S. shabanensis cells showed the greatest resistance, while Buttiauxella sp. was completely inactivated and S. capitis only survived when protected from UV radiation. The results highlight a wide variation in microbial survival and suggest that pigmented fungi could be resistant to the Martian surface if inadvertently transported by spacecraft, which is relevant for planetary protection.",9
In situ linkage of fungal and bacterial proliferation to microbiologically influenced corrosion in B20 biodiesel storage tanks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055474/,"situ linkage, fungal and bacterial proliferation","Biodiesel (B20) is a promising renewable fuel, but it is susceptible to biodegradation and microbial corrosion, an understudied problem *in situ*. This study, the first of its scale, conducted a year-long investigation in operational U.S. Air Force B20 tanks to assess microbial proliferation, fuel degradation, and microbiologically influenced corrosion. Diverse and unique bacterial populations were identified for each location, while eukaryotic populations, such as the filamentous fungi Trichocomaceae and the yeasts Saccharomycetaceae, were consistent across sites. A key finding was the correlation between increased Trichocomaceae abundance and visible fouling and pitting corrosion. The study was able to establish a relationship between B20 fouling, increased corrosion, and the responsible microorganisms, primarily at the bottom of the tanks.",8

Nature of pre-earthquake phenomena and their effects on living organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4494396/,"nature, pre earthquake, phenomena, and, their, living","The text addresses the difficulty of predicting earthquakes, highlighting that although traditional seismology is based on past data, numerous non-seismic signals exist prior to the events. It criticizes mechanistic explanations such as microfracturing and the electrokinetic effect for being inconsistent with depth conditions. Instead, it proposes a theory involving the activation of ""positive holes"" (hâ€¢), electronic charge carriers formed in silicate minerals under stress. These positive holes are highly mobile, generating ultra-low frequency (ULF/ELF) electromagnetic waves that can reach the surface. Upon arrival, they ionize the air and oxidize the water, which could explain the unusual animal behavior and other physical and chemical anomalies observed before earthquakes.",6
The rapid diagnosis and effective inhibition of coronavirus using spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323809/,Rapid diagnosis and effective inhibition of coronavirus,"Gold nanoparticles functionalized with anti-spike antibodies have been developed for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. This system detects the virus or its antigen within 5 minutes through a colorimetric change from pink to blue, observable with the naked eye. It also employs surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for ultrasensitive detection within the same timeframe, identifying the antigen at concentrations of picograms per milliliter and the virus at very low particles per milliliter. Beyond diagnosis, these nanoparticles demonstrate the ability to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells by binding to its spike protein, preventing infection and spread, and can even destroy its lipid membrane.",7
Blocking SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain binding with the ACE2 receptor of the host cell and inhibiting virus infections using human host defense peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8886715/,"blocking, sars cov 2, delta, variant, 617, spike","study reveals that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) conjugated with human defense peptides (HNP1 and LL-37) can block the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) into host cells. These bioconjugates prevent the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein to the ACE2 receptor, showing a high binding affinity (9 nM), comparable to that of the ACE2-S protein interaction, and a higher affinity for the delta variant than for other variants. Experimental assays confirm complete inhibition of delta variant pseudovirion entry and low cytotoxicity in cell lines, offering a potential new strategy against infection.",9
Safety and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered heparin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8890767/,Safety and pharmacokinetics intranasally administered heparin,"This study investigated the safety and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) as a potential prophylactic agent for COVID-19. Daily intranasal doses of UFH were administered to mice for 14 days, and its safety was tested in a small group of healthy human subjects. The results showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any of the measured doses, nor significant changes in blood coagulation or minor irritant events. Similarly, human subjects did not present significant changes in coagulation parameters or serious adverse events. Pharmacokinetic analysis in mice revealed a single-phase clearance, with potentially protective levels of UFH remaining in the nasal cavity for up to 12 hours after administration. Overall, UFH demonstrated no toxic effects with prolonged daily intranasal use in both mice and humans.",6
Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains by marine sulfated glycans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9487896/,"inhibition, sars cov 2, wild type, wuhan hu 1, and, delta","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules, focusing on the virus's S protein, whose binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is key to infection. However, rapid mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, such as those observed in the Delta variant, present a challenge for inhibitor design. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) have shown promise by competitively disrupting the interaction between the S protein and HSPGs. This study evaluated seven different MSGs against the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 strains. Although all MSGs displayed strong inhibitory activity against both strains (generally similar to or slightly lower than heparin), no correlation was found between their structural characteristics and viral inhibition. Nevertheless, the study shows that MSGs maintain their inhibitory activity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting their potential as effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules with low cytotoxicity.",7
Inhibition of Cytomegalovirus by Pentacta pygmaea Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate Depends on Its Molecular Weight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10142442/,inhibition cytomegalovirus pentacta pygmaea fucosylated chondroitin,"recent study investigated fucosylchondroitin sulfate from the starfish Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) as a potential antiviral agent against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). HCMV binds to host cells via heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans prior to entry, and PpFucCS was shown to potently inhibit this viral entry by blocking interactions between HS and the virus. Antiviral activity was found to be proportional to the chain length of PpFucCS, with its high molecular weight being a key structural element for maximal effect. Furthermore, PpFucCS and its derivatives did not show significant cytotoxicity and protected infected cells. These findings suggest that this novel marine sulfated glycan could be developed as a prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.",7
Effect of simulated cosmic radiation on cytomegalovirus reactivation and lytic replication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11477029/,"simulated, cosmic, radiation, cytomegalovirus, reactivation, and","Space exploration exposes astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which has previously been linked to the reactivation of latent herpesviruses. One study investigated how GCR and other types of radiation affect cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in human cells. It was found that radiation exposure, including simulated GCR, significantly increased viral copy numbers, indicating CMV reactivation. Although no substantial genomic changes were detected, transcriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of the UL49 gene, suggesting it as a key factor in the shift from the latent to the lytic phase of the virus. These findings support the hypothesis that GCR is an important contributor to the CMV reactivation observed in the International Space Station crew.",7
Tissue Retrieval and Postharvest Processing Regimen for Rodent Reproductive Tissues Compatible with Long-Term Storage on the International Space Station and Postflight Biospecimen Sharing Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309301/,tissue retrieval and postharvest processing regimen,"The text details the development of a strategy for collecting and processing animal tissues after spaceflight, with the aim of preserving the effects of flight and minimizing post-flight alterations. The research focused on establishing optimal time windows for post-euthanasia tissue collection, specific to each species and tissue (primarily reproductive), as well as long-term storage methods compatible with the International Space Station (10 months at -80°C) that ensure the recovery of high-quality RNA and proteins. The results indicate that histological integrity is maintained between 1 and 3 hours post-euthanasia, depending on the tissue and species, and RNA quality is preserved for up to 40 minutes in RNAlater. This strategy, which also standardizes post-fixation processing for shipping, is adaptable to biospecimen exchange programs and seeks to maximize the information obtained from animals on space missions given limited study opportunities.",9
Effects of sex and gender on adaptations to space: reproductive health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,"sex, and, gender, adaptations, space, reproductive","The text describes how spaceflight affects insulin and estrogen signaling in mice and humans. In mice, pronounced changes were detected in the liver, resulting in signaling inhibition, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. In humans, alterations in genes and pathways related to insulin and estrogen were observed, associated with insulin resistance, stress response, and viral infections. These findings highlight the need to further investigate the metabolic and endocrinological effects of spaceflight for the success of future interplanetary missions.",7
Effects of spaceflight on the muscles of the murine shoulder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343501/,"spaceflight, muscles, murine, shoulder","This study investigated the effects of mechanical unloading on the shoulder enthesis, the junction between bone and tendon, in adult mice. The shoulders of mice were paralyzed for 21 days with botulinum toxin A, revealing a significant increase in mechanical failure and hierarchical structural changes. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss; at the micrometer scale, it decreased the size and alignment of bioapatite crystals; and at the nanometer scale, it induced compositional changes that stiffened the tissue composed of bioapatite and collagen. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these combined factors increased local stress levels and decreased the tissue's ability to absorb energy before failure, thereby increasing the risk of injury. These observations provide new insights into how unloading affects the adult enthesis and its characteristics that confer resistance to failure.",7
Multiscale effects of spaceflight on murine tendon and bone,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138367/,multiscale spaceflight murine tendon and bone,"This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the enthesis (the tendon-bone junction) in mice from the STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 space missions. Nanoscale results showed decreased carbonate levels in bone, possibly due to increased remodeling, and a shift in tendon collagen fibril size toward smaller diameters, which could be due to increased collagen degradation. However, these nanoscale changes did not translate into significant alterations in micro- and milliscale structure and mechanics, as no changes were observed in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness. This suggests that the tendon enthesis could be robust against the negative tissue effects of spaceflight, perhaps due to its anatomical location in the limbs.",8
Reproducible changes in the gut microbiome suggest a shift in microbial and host metabolism during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6689164/,"reproducible, changes, gut, microbiome, suggest, shift","This study examined the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiota of mice, analyzing fecal samples following a 37-day mission on the International Space Station. The results showed an increase in microbial alpha diversity and an alteration in community structure, changes that were reproducible with data from previous space missions but not with ground-based radiation studies, suggesting the influence of other factors. Significant alterations in the abundance of specific microbial taxa and in microbial energy metabolism capacity were identified. Furthermore, a correlation was found between host liver genes related to protein metabolism and gut microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. These findings are crucial for understanding the role of gut microbiota in mammalian health in space and developing countermeasures for future space missions.",8
Failure to Generate Bone Marrow Adipocytes Does Not Protect Mice from Ovariectomy-Induced Osteopenia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564669/,"failure, generate, bone, marrow, adipocytes, does","A study investigated whether bone marrow fat contributes to ovariectomy-induced osteopenia (ovx) in mice, comparing wild-type (WT) mice with mice deficient in marrow adipocytes (kitW/Wv). It was found that although ovx increased body fat and bone marrow adiposity in WT mice (whereas kitW/Wv mice lacked marrow adipocytes), the surgery-induced changes in bone mass and formation were statistically indistinguishable between the two genotypes. The findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in mice.",9
Acute exposure to high dose gamma-radiation results in transient activation of bone lining cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042434/,acute exposure high dose gamma radiation results,"The studies investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of high-dose whole-body gamma irradiation on bone, and the efficacy of radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation as interventions. Irradiation with 6 Gy resulted in increased trabecular thickness and separation, and reduced cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and number of trabeculae in the tibia and vertebrae. At the cellular level, a decrease in marrow cell density, a transient increase in bone formation (associated with marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells), and an increase in bone resorption were observed. Radioadaptation (priming dose of 0.5 mGy) had a minimal effect on cellular responses and did not prevent bone changes. However, bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most bone architectural indices after irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced bone marrow cell death is associated with a transient increase in bone formation and increased bone resorption, and bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating these detrimental effects.",8
Morbid obesity attenuates the skeletal abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161659/,"morbid, obesity, attenuates, skeletal, abnormalities, associated","study evaluated the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency, differentiating them from those associated with morbid obesity, in wild-type mice, ad libitum-fed ob/ob mice, and pair-fed ob/ob mice. Ob/ob mice showed lower bone mass and density, as well as reduced bone turnover resulting in pathological cartilage retention. Pair-fed ob/ob mice, although less obese than ad libitum ob/ob mice, also showed reductions in bone mass and turnover, but with greater bone marrow adiposity and greater cancellous bone and cartilage volume at certain sites. The findings demonstrate that skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are significantly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.",7
Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces body weight without accelerating age-related bone loss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917201/,hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces body,"Given the challenges of conventional weight control methods and their adverse effects such as bone loss, this study investigated the efficacy of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy in adult female rats for weight reduction and its impact on bone health. Over 18 weeks, rats treated with rAAV-leptin lost weight, unlike control rats, which gained weight, resulting in a significant reduction in body weight and abdominal adipose tissue in the leptin group. Although weight loss occurred, no significant differences in bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or bone remodeling biomarkers were detected between groups, indicating that leptin therapy maintained a lower body weight with minimal effects on the skeleton.",9
Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy Reduces Bone Marrow Adiposity in ob/ob Mice Fed Regular and High-Fat Diets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985531/,hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces bone,"The study examined the long-term impact of hypothalamic leptin, delivered via gene therapy (rAAV-Lep), on bone marrow adiposity (BMA) and bone formation in ob/ob (leptin-deficient) mice fed regular or high-fat diets. Given the association between low bone mass and elevated BMA, and the common origin of osteoblasts and adipocytes from mesenchymal stem cells, the study sought to determine whether leptin, a regulatory hormone, could mitigate the increased BMA and reduced bone formation observed in leptin deficiency and diet-induced obesity. The findings revealed that this therapy reduced TMA in ob/ob mice to levels similar to those in wild-type mice and increased osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters, albeit with minor changes in bone architecture. This suggests a crucial role for leptin in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, a process possibly dysregulated by high-fat diets. However, it was observed that reducing TMA by increasing leptin does not always lead to increased bone mass.",8
Room temperature housing results in premature cancellous bone loss in growing female mice: implications for the mouse as a preclinical model for age-related bone loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421618/,"room, temperature, housing, results, premature, cancellous","This study investigated the impact of housing temperature on bone growth, turnover, and microarchitecture in female mice, used as preclinical models for osteoporosis. Mice housed at standard room temperature (22°C) were observed to experience significant cancellous bone loss during growth, in contrast to humans. However, when housed at a thermoneutral temperature (32°C), mice maintained or even increased their cortical and cancellous bone mass. These beneficial effects were associated with lower expression of the Ucp1 gene in brown adipose tissue, greater adiposity in bone marrow, higher rates of bone formation, higher expression of osteogenic genes, and lower bone resorption. The findings suggest that failure to account for species differences in thermoregulation, particularly ambient temperature, may bias osteoporosis studies in mice, and that thermoneutral housing could improve their usefulness as models.",10
Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515514/,"spaceflight induced, vertebral, bone, loss, ovariectomized, rats","The study evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, resorption, formation, and marrow adipose tissue (MAT) in the lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The results showed that spaceflight rats had a 32% reduction in cancellous bone area and a 306% increase in MAT, due to a greater number and size of adipocytes. Bone loss was associated with a significant increase in bone resorption (16% more resorption and 229% more osteoclast perimeter), but there were no changes in the rate of mineral apposition or osteoblast activity or differentiation. This suggests that cancellous bone loss during spaceflight is accompanied by an increase in bone resorption and TMA, without a compensatory increase in bone formation, indicating defective coupling. The findings do not support the hypothesis that elevated MAT directly reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan, but are consistent with the idea that, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, mesenchymal stem cells are skewed toward adipocytes at the expense of osteoblast formation.",10
Role of estrogen receptor signaling in skeletal response to leptin in female ob/ob mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8671758/,role estrogen receptor signaling skeletal response,"The study examines how leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice results in contrasting bone growth patterns, with shorter femurs but longer spines, and explores the role of estrogen receptors (ERs) in regulating these patterns. It was confirmed that ob/ob mice have shorter femurs and longer spines than wild-type mice, with contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proteins in the growth plates. The analysis indicated a positive relationship between body length and ER expression in the growth plate. However, treatment with ERÎ± and ERÎ² antagonists in ob/ob mice revealed that leptin deficiency disrupts the expected regulatory effects of these antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. This suggests that specific ERÎ± expression may be associated with the contrasting axial and appendicular bone growth phenotypes, although ER signaling is attenuated by leptin deficiency in these mice, requiring further investigation of the complex interplay between the two.",7
Effects of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771473/,"hypothalamic, leptin, gene, therapy, osteopetrosis, leptin deficient","This study investigated whether mild osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice, caused by leptin deficiency, is self-limiting and reversible. Histomorphometric analyses of femurs showed that cartilage persisted in ob/ob mice even at six months of age, suggesting that the condition is not completely self-limiting. However, gene therapy that restored leptin signaling in ob/ob mice resulted in the elimination or significant reduction of cartilage in the bone, associated with increased bone turnover. The findings conclude that leptin is essential for normal cartilage replacement with bone and that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment-specific and reversible with leptin treatment at sites with robust bone turnover.",7
Leptin stimulates bone formation in ob/ob mice at doses having minimal impact on energy metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288125/,"leptin stimulates bone formation, mice, doses","This study in ob/ob mice investigated the peripheral effects of leptin on bone formation, differentiating them from its central effects on energy metabolism due to limited transport across the blood-brain barrier. Leptin was found to increase bone formation parameters at lower serum doses (EC50 of 7–17 ng/h) compared with indices of energy metabolism (EC50 of 40–80 ng/h). Specifically, a 12 ng/h leptin infusion increased the expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in the tibia, with minimal impact on the hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition with energy availability, and its restricted transport across the blood-brain barrier ensures that its growth-promoting actions are not mitigated by its central nervous system-mediated anorectic effects.",8
Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue Deficiency Increases Disuse-Induced Bone Loss in Male Mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389344/,"bone, marrow, adipose, tissue, deficiency, increases","study investigated the hypothesis that bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) deficiency would protect against disuse-induced bone loss. MAT-deficient mice (KitW/W?¹v) and wild-type mice were subjected to a hindlimb (HU) unloading model. Contrary to the hypothesis, MAT-deficient mice experienced a significantly greater reduction in bone volume fraction and more exaggerated loss of cancellous bone after unloading, despite having better initial bone quality. They also showed elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption and a distinct genetic profile. An additional experiment involving adoptive transfer of wild-type hematopoietic stem cells into KitW/W?¹v mice (maintaining MAT deficiency) confirmed unloading-induced bone loss. The results suggest that MAT deficiency does not protect against disuse bone loss but is instead associated with exaggerated cancellous bone loss.",9

Mrc1?/? mice showed impaired bone marrow hematopoiesis, with fewer myeloid progenitors and mature cells, but increased adipocytes in the bone marrow. Furthermore, they had reduced levels of circulating neutrophils and proinflammatory monocytes, along with decreased macrophage infiltration in visceral adipose tissue and the liver. This was associated with decreased hepatic steatosis, improved glucose and insulin response, and reduced weight gain. The results suggest that Mrc1 deficiency during a HFD diet impacts bone marrow and circulating immune cells, leading to reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to the development of obesity, indicating a role for Mrc1 in the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity.",8
Maintenance of near normal bone mass and architecture in lethally irradiated female mice following adoptive transfer with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548323/,"maintenance, near, normal, bone, mass, and","This study sought to establish an approach to reconstitute bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) following lethal total body irradiation (TBI) without adversely affecting bone metabolism. Mice were irradiated and transplanted with whole bone marrow cells or purified HSCs. Analysis confirmed that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor cells. Minimal differences were observed in the skeleton of wild-type mice transplanted with HSCs and fractionated doses of radiation, whereas radiosensitive KitW/Wv mice developed osteopenia at high doses, but not at lower doses, and transplantation of wild-type cells restored normal Kit expression. These findings provide strong evidence of efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI, with minimal collateral bone damage, which will be useful for investigating how hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.",10

Ob/ob mice showed higher body weight, more adipose tissue, and alterations in bone microarchitecture and mass compared with WT mice. Limb unloading resulted in lower bone density and volume in the femur and a reduction in bone volume fraction in the distal femur and lumbar vertebrae in both genotypes, associated with an increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. However, leptin deficiency did not attenuate unloading-induced osteopenia, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss caused by non-weight-bearing.",7
Thermoneutral housing attenuates premature cancellous bone loss in male C57BL/6J mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865368/,"thermoneutral, housing, attenuates, premature, cancellous, bone","This study determined whether housing at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) prevents premature bone loss in male mice, an effect previously observed in females. Male C57BL/6J mice maintained at standard room temperature (22°C) exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume in the distal femur and fifth lumbar vertebra, effects that were abolished under thermoneutral conditions. Thermoneutral housing was associated with increased levels of bone formation and decreased levels of bone resorption. The magnitude of room temperature-induced bone loss did not differ between males and females. The findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies of aging-related bone metabolism in mice of both sexes.",8
Effects of Spaceflight on Cancellous and Cortical Bone in Proximal Femur in Growing Rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907224/,spaceflight cancellous and cortical bone proximal,"The text describes how spaceflight affects bone microarchitecture, specifically in the femoral head of growing rats. Across three spaceflight missions (STS-41, STS-57, STS-62) with ovariectomized male and female rats, spaceflight was consistently observed to result in cancellous osteopenia, that is, a reduction in the volume fraction of cancellous bone. This bone loss was significant in flight rats compared to controls, and was more evident in ovariectomized females, where net bone loss was reported. However, no differences in cortical thickness were found. These findings suggest a generalized response of cancellous bone in the femoral head to microgravity.",10
Evidence for increased thermogenesis in female C57BL/6J mice housed aboard the international space station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213760/,evidence for increased thermogenesis female c57bl,"study using female C57BL/6J mice aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days revealed that spaceflight induces significant changes in adipose tissue gene expression. Differential gene expression was observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis (including 1.5-fold higher levels of Ucp-1), and in white adipose tissue (WAT), indicating increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and Î²-oxidation, in addition to possible WAT browning. The researchers conclude that adaptive thermogenesis is enhanced in mice in microgravity, which is relevant because it could exacerbate or alter other physiological responses to spaceflight (such as bone loss or radiation response) and affect the applicability of these studies to astronauts due to differences in thermoregulation between species.",8
Leptin and environmental temperature as determinants of bone marrow adiposity in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9582271/,Leptin and environmental temperature determinants bone,"The text describes an investigation into the effects of ambient temperature and leptin on bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in mice, addressing previous conflicting findings. Two experiments were conducted in female mice housed at 32°C (thermoneutral). The first experiment indicated that leptin supplementation reduced BMAT and increased bone formation. The second revealed that increased temperature elevated BMAT in wild-type and leptin-deficient mice, suggesting a leptin-independent response to temperature, but that leptin infusion attenuated this increase. In summary, elevated housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.",9
Small changes in thermoregulation influence cancellous bone turnover balance in distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10063413/,"small, changes, thermoregulation, influence, cancellous, bone","Mice are routinely housed at temperatures below their thermoneutral zone, which causes cold stress and cancellous bone loss, and can alter experimental results. This study evaluated how small temperature differences (22°C vs. 26°C) or group housing with nests at 22°C affect bone health in growing C57BL/6 J mice. Mice housed individually at 22°C experienced significant cancellous bone loss in the distal femoral metaphysis. This loss was attenuated, but not completely prevented, by housing them individually at 26°C or in groups with nests at 22°C. The results conclude that modest differences in housing conditions, by influencing thermogenesis or heat loss, can affect experimental results, especially in the bone study.",8
Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue Is Not Required for Reconstitution of the Immune System Following Irradiation in Male Mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10889206/,"bone, marrow, adipose, tissue, not, required","This study investigated whether bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is required for immune reconstitution and maintaining bone turnover balance after severe injury, such as lethal irradiation, in mice. Wild-type mice were compared with BMAT-deficient mice after adoptive hematopoietic stem cell transfer. The findings revealed excellent immune system reconstitution in both groups, with no significant differences in magnitude. Similarly, minimal differences in bone parameters and microarchitecture were observed between mice with and without BMAT. This suggests that BMAT is not a requirement for immune system reconstitution after lethal radiation, nor a major contributor to skeletal characteristics in Kit signaling-deficient mice in this setting.",10
Simulated Microgravity Promotes Horizontal Gene Transfer of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes between Bacterial Genera in the Absence of Antibiotic Selective Pressure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468678/,simulated microgravity promotes horizontal gene transfer,"This study investigated horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a key mechanism in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment. Donor bacteria (*Acinetobacter pittii*) with resistance genes (*blaOXA-500* and *ISAba1*) and antibiotic-susceptible recipient *Staphylococcus aureus* strains, both isolated from the International Space Station, were co-cultured under SMG and normal gravity (1G). The results showed that *S. aureus* strains co-cultured in SMG acquired significantly more antibiotic resistance genes than those grown in 1G, developing phenotypic resistance to oxacillin. This suggests that microgravity may promote increased gene shedding among bacterial communities, posing a potential health risk to astronauts on extended space missions.",8

To this end, it proposes a series of microbial biotechnologies designed for in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and loop-closure (resource recycling and reuse), essential for missions beyond low-Earth orbit and for ethical considerations. These biotechnologies can be applied in life support systems, human waste management (transforming it into food or nutrients), food production (harnessing the plant microbiome and probiotics), and pharmaceutical manufacturing in space, reducing dependence on terrestrial supplies. It is emphasized that while these innovations are based on existing Earth-based technologies, they require extensive research and development to adapt to space conditions, and that their advances could also be beneficial for terrestrial applications, supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",9

The authors identify and mathematically describe a unique 3D ""rolling"" maneuver that, combined with two-dimensional turning, allows the nematode to explore voluminous media while swimming and burrowing. This rolling maneuver involves a body twist that rotates the undulation plane, facilitating complete reorientation in space. The faster rolls during swimming are observed due to a hydrodynamic improvement, not a change in gait. The results provide crucial insights into 3D neuromuscular performance and can improve locomotion phenotype analyses by generalizing the harmonic curvature model to 3D motion descriptions by introducing curve torsion.",7

This new method exploits size differences between developmental stages, employing sequential filtration with 40 Âµm and 20 Âµm meshes to isolate embryos. The optimized protocol, which includes the use of OP50 bacteria and the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), results in a higher embryo yield per plate and produces healthier larvae, without deleterious effects on their subsequent development, making it ideal for high-throughput assays.",6

This study establishes a swimming exercise regimen for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that induces neuromuscular, intestinal, and cognitive improvements, as well as protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Exercise performed exclusively in early adulthood was found to produce lasting systemic benefits detectable into middle age, with multiple daily swimming sessions being essential for adaptation. This training improves health parameters such as muscle gene expression, locomotor performance, mitochondrial morphology, and mid-life survival, establishing C. elegans as a powerful genetic model for unraveling the molecular circuitry underlying the systemic benefits of exercise.",8

Tart Cherry Increases Lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by Altering Metabolic Signaling Pathways,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285199/,"tart, cherry, increases, lifespan,caenorhabditis, elegans","Tart cherry extract (TCE) was investigated in C. elegans for its potential anti-aging effects. Supplementation with TCE, at concentrations of 6 ?g or 12 ?g/mL, was found to significantly increase the average lifespan of wild-type worms. These benefits were associated with increased expression of longevity-related genes, such as daf-16 and aak-2, and genes linked to oxidative stress, such as sod-2. Furthermore, TCE improved mitochondrial function by increasing reserve respiration. However, TCE did not alter the lifespan of *daf-16* and *aak-2* mutant worms, suggesting that its effects were primarily mediated through the DAF-16 pathway. In conclusion, the findings indicate that TCE confers health benefits and reduces oxidative stress in *C. elegans* through improved mitochondrial function and the DAF-16 axis.",7

It focuses on the ""interkinase"" (IK) region, a segment between its two kinase domains, characterized by low complexity and high proline content. In vitro experiments using single-molecule force spectroscopy demonstrated that a 571-residue portion of the UNC-89 IK functions as both an entropic coil and a random coil. Using CRISPR/Cas9, nematodes with an in-frame deletion of this IK region were generated, which displayed severe muscle sarcomere disorganization, defective locomotion, and reduced muscle strength, with super-resolution microscopy revealing abnormal A-banding. Additionally, an N-terminal HA tag introduced during the CRISPR process unexpectedly reduced levels of giant UNC-89 isoforms and caused muscle dysfunction independent of the IK deletion. This work is the first to elucidate the critical functional role of the interkinase region within the UNC-89/obscurin family.",7

Previous research has shown that genes associated with muscle junctional complexes decrease in microgravity, but it was unknown whether this affected muscle strength across generations. To investigate this, the NemaFlex microfluidic device (called NemaFlex-S) was redesigned to measure C. elegans muscle strength in space. Technical improvements include a design that allows for animal sorting and housing, a fluid handling protocol that prevents clogging, and a customized worm loading apparatus, all optimized for the constraints of space missions and the International Space Station (ISS), including crew time and safety. Additionally, a robust protocol was developed for the multigenerational cultivation of *C. elegans* in a specific liquid medium and oxygen-permeable bags, overcoming the challenges of traditional cultivation methods. Following validation on Earth, this integrated hardware was sent to the ISS to measure *C. elegans* strength over eight generations, with the goal of assessing short- and long-term muscle adaptation to microgravity.",9

Previous studies indicated that Cr(VI) misregulates the HR-essential protein RAD51, preventing its proper nuclear localization and causing its cytoplasmic accumulation. This study examined the effect of Cr(VI) on RAD51C and BRCA2, mediators of RAD51 nuclear import. Acute (24 h) exposure to Cr(VI) was found to induce proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. However, prolonged exposure (120 h) increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, with RAD51C more severely affected, correlating with the previously reported cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Furthermore, Cr(VI) does not inhibit the interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. The findings suggest that prolonged exposure to Cr(VI) inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C and, to a lesser extent, BRCA2, resulting in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. This inhibition of nuclear import could play a crucial role in the carcinogenic mechanism of Cr(VI).",7

The mice were vaccinated with tetanus toxoid and an adjuvant, and transcriptomics was used to analyze the effects on the heart. The results showed that immunization in space stimulates increased cardiac inflammation, activating the NF-? signaling pathway and promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN?, IL-17, and IL-6. These findings suggest that immunization in space can induce inflammation in the heart, similar to terrestrial myocarditis, and highlight the need for future research into cardiac events during spaceflight.",7
Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11748630/,analyzing relationship between gene expression and,"study investigates the detrimental effects of spaceflight on the liver health of rodents, focusing on liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation. To identify genes and molecular targets more accurately than traditional methods, which often detect spurious correlations, the researchers employed CRISP (Causal Research and Inference Search Platform), a suite of machine learning methods based on causal inference. Using transcriptomic and histological data from the livers of space and control mice from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), CRISP identified a unique set of high-density lipid-predictive genes implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that were missed by previous analyses. This work represents the first machine learning analysis predictive of a liver disease-related response in spaceflight, paving the way for the development of countermeasures for future long-duration space missions.",9
Sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations to simulated microgravity in Sprague-Dawley rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11659408/,"sex specific, cardiovascular, adaptations, simulated, microgravity, sprague dawley","This study investigated sex-specific cardiovascular responses to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HLU) in rats. Female rats exposed to HLU were found to develop increased aortic stiffness, lower levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and PPAR?, increased oxidative stress, and diastolic dysfunction. Males, however, showed no changes in aortic stiffness or other parameters following HLU. Administration of a GPER agonist prevented arterial stiffness and oxidative stress in female rats exposed to HLU, highlighting sex-differentiated vascular adaptations to simulated microgravity and the potential role of GPER in female arterial stiffness.",9

Artificial gravity attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11593819/,artificial gravity attenuates transcriptomic response spaceflight,"Microgravity during spaceflight negatively affects astronaut ocular health by inducing transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress, which contribute to spaceflight-associated neuroocular syndrome (SANS). A study in mice on the International Space Station demonstrated that artificial gravity, generated by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, attenuates these damaging transcriptomic responses in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, an artificial gravity of 1 G was the most effective in reverting genetic changes to control levels and mitigating oxidative stress in the retina. These findings suggest that artificial gravity is a promising countermeasure to protect eye tissue from the damaging effects of space.",9
Effect of simulated cosmic radiation on cytomegalovirus reactivation and lytic replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11477029/,"simulated, cosmic, radiation, cytomegalovirus, reactivation, and","A study addressed reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) due to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a risk to human space exploration. When CMV-infected Kasumi cells were irradiated with various radiations (including simulated GCR), a significant increase in viral copy number was observed, indicating reactivation. Although no notable genomic differences were found, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latency to lytic replication. These results support the hypothesis that GCR is an important factor in the CMV reactivation observed in space crew members.",7
Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,protein kinase giant sarcomeric unc 89 regulates,"This scientific article investigates the giant protein UNC-89 in *C. elegans*, essential for sarcomere organization and muscle function, which contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2. The study confirms that PK2 is a catalytically active kinase. By inactivating PK2 through a mutation, the researchers found that while the mutant worms maintained normal sarcomeres and muscle function, they exhibited fragmented mitochondria, elevated ATP levels, increased glycolysis, and altered mitochondrial respiration suggesting uncoupling. These results suggest a signaling pathway from sarcomeres to mitochondria to match energy needs to production, with UNC-89 PK2 playing a key role in this communication.",7

Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11451251/,"adaptation, space, conditions, novel, bacterial, species","This study analyzed five new species of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) using a deep learning tool for functional annotation. Genomic and proteomic adaptations to the extreme conditions of space were identified, such as handling of hypo-osmotic stress, enhanced DNA repair activity, and the presence of mobile genetic elements. The findings also suggest the evolution of genetic traits that indicate potential pathogenic capabilities and increased antibiotic resistance compared to their terrestrial relatives. The collective annotations and the presence of novel biosynthetic gene clusters suggest a convergent adaptation of these microorganisms to life in space, which could have implications for the bioproduction of biomolecules or serve as potential drug targets.",10

Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11386075/,"predicting, how, varying, moisture, conditions, impact","Increased human activity in space requires predictive models for microbial growth in enclosed environments such as the International Space Station (ISS), where high humidity can lead to unwanted growth, affecting astronaut health and the integrity of spacecraft. This study demonstrated that even short exposures to high relative humidity can facilitate rapid growth and changes in the composition of microbial communities in spacecraft dust. Fungal growth in ISS dust was modeled using a ""wetting time"" framework, and a significant increase in fungal concentration and a reduction in their diversity was observed with increasing humidity and exposure time. Although the model was not applicable to bacteria, their communities also showed changes with increasing humidity. These results are crucial for developing strategies to protect astronaut health, strengthen spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection during future missions.",8
Spaceflight alters host-gut microbiota interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11362537/,"spaceflight, alters, host gut, microbiota, interactions","Spaceflight induces symptoms such as liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy in mammals. This study explored the gut microbiota and host gene expression in mice after 29 and 56 days in space using multi-omics. Changes were observed in 44 microbial species, with a reduction in bile acid and butyrate-metabolizing bacteria. Functional predictions and host gene expression showed alterations in fatty acid, bile acid, and energy metabolism, as well as immunosuppression. These findings suggest that host-microbiome interactions contribute to spaceflight pathology, an area where metabolic and immunological dysfunctions have previously been documented. In-flight mice also experienced weight gain and significant differences in their gut microbiome composition (beta diversity) compared to controls, although overall microbial diversity remained unchanged.",7

These studies suggest that the space environment may be advantageous for culturing stem cells in a more natural 3D format, which could lead to increased production of high-quality cells. The ultimate goal is to translate these discoveries to Earth-based clinical applications, improving cell therapies and regenerative medicine for the benefit of patients.",10
Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11324864/,"simulated, microgravity, impairs, human, natural, killer","This study investigates how simulated microgravity (sigma-Aldrich) affects the function of Natural Killer (NK) cells, critical for antitumor defense, during prolonged space missions. The results demonstrate that a 48-hour exposure to sigma-Aldrich significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of human NK cells, both cell lines and primary cells, against K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemia lines. This deleterious effect was even more pronounced when sigma-Aldrich conditions were maintained continuously throughout the cytotoxicity assessment, suggesting that previous studies may have underestimated the true impact. The marked reduction in MOLT-4 cell killing is particularly concerning given the potential link between space radiation and the induction of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RNA-seq analyses of NK cells exposed to sÎ¼G revealed altered pathways, which could guide the development of countermeasures to mitigate the risk. The study concludes that microgravity could increase the risk of leukemogenesis in astronauts during extended missions beyond low-Earth orbit, warranting further research.",10
Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,"simulated, microgravity, alters, gene, regulation, linked","This study investigated cardiac responses to prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloading (HU) model in male and female Long-Evans rats of different ages. It was hypothesized that microgravity and subsequent recovery would increase oxidative damage and alter gene expression. The results showed sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage (8-OHdG marker) and antioxidant gene expression in the left ventricle. Young females (3 months old) exhibited elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU, unlike age-matched males. In 9-month-old males, the analysis of RNAseq after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of proinflammatory signaling pathways, immune cell activation, and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. These findings highlight the need to consider sex differences and target antioxidant and immune pathways in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.",8
Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"spaceflight, increases, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, ca2, leak","This study investigated the effect of the antioxidant BuOE on muscle atrophy and SERCA pump dysfunction in the soleus muscle of mice exposed to 35 days of microgravity, an environment known to cause muscle weakness and atrophy due to Ca2+ dysregulation and oxidative stress. The results showed that spaceflight induced significant muscle atrophy in the soleus, increased Ca2+ leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and elevated levels of a marker of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, with BuOE treatment unable to counteract any of these effects. It is concluded that BuOE does not attenuate microgravity-induced muscle atrophy or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leakage, suggesting the need to explore alternative treatments.",8
